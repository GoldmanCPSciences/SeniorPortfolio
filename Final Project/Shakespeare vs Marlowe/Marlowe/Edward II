GAVESTON

    “My father is deceas’d! Come, Gaveston,
    And share the kingdom with thy dearest friend,”
    Ah! words that make me surfeit with delight!
    What greater bliss can hap to Gaveston 4
    Than live and be the favourite of a king!
    Sweet prince, I come; these, these thy amorous lines
    Might have enforc’d me to have swum from France,
    And, like Leander, gasp’d upon the sand, 8
    So thou would’st smile, and take me in thine arms.
    The sight of London to my exil’d eyes
    Is as Elysium to a new-come soul;
    Not that I love the city, or the men, 12
    But that it harbours him I hold so dear—
    The king, upon whose bosom let me die, 1
    And with the world be still at enmity.
    What need the arctic people love starlight, 16
    To whom the sun shines both by day and night?
    Farewell base stooping to the lordly peers!
    My knee shall bow to none but to the king.
    As for the multitude, that are but sparks, 20
    Rak’d up in embers of their poverty;—
    Tanti; 2 I’ll fawn first on the wind
    That glanceth at my lips, and flieth away.

[Enter three Poor Men]

    But how now, what are these? 24

POOR MEN

    Such as desire your worship’s service.

GAVESTON

    What canst thou do?

1ST POOR MAN.

    I can ride.

GAVESTON

    But I have no horses.—What art thou? 28

2ND POOR MAN

    A traveller.

GAVESTON

    Let me see: thou would’st do well
    To wait at my trencher and tell me lies at dinner time;
    And as I like your discoursing, I’ll have you.— 32
    And what art thou?

3RD POOR MAN

    A soldier, that hath serv’d against the Scot.

GAVESTON

    Why, there are hospitals for such as you.
    I have no war, and therefore, sir, begone. 36

3RD POOR MAN

    Farewell, and perish by a soldier’s hand,
    That would’st reward them with an hospital.

GAVESTON

    Ay, ay, these words of his move me as much
    As if a goose should play the porcupine, 40
    And dart her plumes, thinking to pierce my breast.
    But yet it is no pain to speak men fair;
    I’ll flatter these, and make them live in hope.—
    You know that I came lately out of France, [Aside.] 44
    And yet I have not view’d my lord the king;
    If I speed well, I’ll entertain you all.

ALL

    We thank your worship.

GAVESTON

    I have some business: leave me to myself. 48

ALL

    We will wait here about the court.

[Exeunt.]

GAVESTON

    Do. These are not men for me:
    I must have wanton poets, pleasant wits,
    Musicians, that with touching of a string 52
    May draw the pliant king which way I please.
    Music and poetry is his delight;
    Therefore I’ll have Italian masks by night,
    Sweet speeches, comedies, and pleasing shows; 56
    And in the day, when he shall walk abroad,
    Like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad;
    My men, like satyrs grazing on the lawns,
    Shall with their goat-feet dance an antic hay. 3 60
    Sometime a lovely boy in Dian’s shape,
    With hair that gilds the water as it glides,
    Crownets of pearl about his naked arms,
    And in his sportful hands an olive tree, 64
    To hide those parts which men delight to see,
    Shall bathe him in a spring; and there hard by,
    One like ActÆon peeping through the grove
    Shall by the angry goddess be transform’d, 68
    And running in the likeness of an hart
    By yelping hounds pull’d down, and seem to die;—
    Such things as these best please his majesty,
    My lord.—Here comes the king, and the nobles 72
    From the parliament. I’ll stand aside. [Retires.]

[Enter KING EDWARD, LANCASTER, the Elder MORTIMER, Young MORTIMER; EDMUND, EARL of KENT; GUY, EARL of WARWICK, and (Attendants)]

KING EDWARD

    Lancaster!

LANCASTER

    My lord.

GAVESTON

    That Earl of Lancaster do I abhor. [Aside.] 76

KING EDWARD

    Will you not grant me this?—In spite of them
    I’ll have my will; and these two Mortimers,
    That cross me thus, shall know I am displeas’d. [Aside.]

ELDER MORTIMER

    If you love us, my lord, hate Gaveston. 80

GAVESTON

    That villain Mortimer! I’ll be his death. [Aside.]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Mine uncle here, this earl, and I myself
    Were sworn to your father at his death,
    That he should ne’er return into the realm; 84
    And know, my lord, ere I will break my oath,
    This sword of mine, that should offend your foes,
    Shall sleep within the scabbard at thy need,
    And underneath thy banners march who will, 88
    For Mortimer will hang his armour up.

GAVESTON

    Mort Dieu! [Aside.]

KING EDWARD

    Well, Mortimer, I’ll make thee rue these words.
    Beseems it thee to contradict thy king? 92
    Frown’st thou thereat, aspiring Lancaster?
    The sword shall plane the furrows of thy brows,
    And hew these knees that now are grown so stiff.
    I will have Gaveston; and you shall know 96
    What danger’tis to stand against your king.

GAVESTON

    Well done, Ned! [Aside.]

LANCASTER

    My lord, why do you thus incense your peers,
    That naturally would love and honour you 100
    But for that base and obscure Gaveston?
    Four earldoms have I, besides Lancaster,—
    Derby, Salisbury, Lincoln, Leicester,—
    These will I sell, to give my soldiers pay, 104
    Ere Gaveston shall stay within the realm;
    Therefore, if he be come, expel him straight.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Barons and earls, your pride hath made me mute;
    But now I’ll speak, and to the proof, I hope. 108
    I do remember, in my father’s days,
    Lord Percy of the north, being highly mov’d,
    Braved Moubery 4 in presence of the king;
    For which, had not his highness lov’d him well, 112
    He should have lost his head; but with his look
    The undaunted spirit of Percy was appeas’d,
    And Moubery and he were reconcil’d:
    Yet dare you brave the king unto his face?— 116
    Brother, revenge it, and let these their heads
    Preach upon poles, for trespass of their tongues.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    O, our heads!

KING EDWARD

    Ay, yours; and therefore I would wish you grant— 120

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Bridle thy anger, gentle Mortimer.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    I cannot, nor I will not; I must speak.—
    Cousin, our hands I hope shall fence our heads,
    And strike off his that makes you threaten us. 124
    Come, uncle, let us leave the brain-sick king,
    And henceforth parley with our naked swords.

ELDER MORTIMER

    Wiltshire hath men enough to save our heads.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    All Warwickshire will love him for my sake. 5 128

LANCASTER

    And northward Gaveston hath many friends.—
    Adieu, my lord; and either change your mind,
    Or look to see the throne, where you should sit,
    To float in blood; and at thy wanton head, 132
    The glozing 6 head of thy base minion thrown.

[Exeunt (all except KING EDWARD, KENT, GAVESTON and Attendants)]

KING EDWARD

    I cannot brook these haughty menaces.
    Am I a king, and must be overrul’d?—
    Brother, display my ensigns in the field; 136
    I’ll bandy 7 with the barons and the earls,
    And either die or live with Gaveston.

GAVESTON

    I can no longer keep me from my lord. [Comes forward.]

KING EDWARD

    What, Gaveston! welcome!—Kiss not my hand— 140

Embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee.

    Why should’st thou kneel? Know’st thou not who I am?
    Thy friend, thyself, another Gaveston!
    Not Hylas was more mourn’d of Hercules, 144
    Than thou hast been of me since thy exile.

GAVESTON

    And since I went from hence, no soul in hell
    Hath felt more torment than poor Gaveston.

KING EDWARD

    I know it.—Brother, welcome home my friend. 148
    Now let the treacherous Mortimers conspire,
    And that high-minded Earl of Lancaster:
    I have my wish, in that I joy thy sight;
    And sooner shall the sea o’erwhelm my land, 152
    Than bear the ship that shall transport thee hence.
    I here create thee Lord High Chamberlain,
    Chief Secretary to the state and me,
    Earl of Cornwall, King and Lord of Man. 156

GAVESTON

    My lord, these titles far exceed my worth.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Brother, the least of these may well suffice
    For one of greater birth than Gaveston.

KING EDWARD

    Cease, brother, for I cannot brook these words. 160
    Thy worth, sweet friend, is far above my gifts,
    Therefore, to equal it, receive my heart.
    If for these dignities thou be envied,
    I’ll give thee more; for, but to honour thee, 164
    Is Edward pleas’d with kingly regiment. 8
    Fear’st 9 thou thy person? Thou shalt have a guard.
    Wantest thou gold? Go to my treasury.
    Wouldst thou be lov’d and fear’d? Receive my seal; 168
    Save or condemn, and in our name command
    Whatso thy mind affects, or fancy likes.

GAVESTON

    It shall suffice me to enjoy your love,
    Which whiles I have, I think myself as great 172
    As CÆsar riding in the Roman street,
    With captive kings at his triumphant car.

[Enter the BISHOP of COVENTRY]

KING EDWARD

    Whither goes my lord of Coventry so fast?
    BISHOP OF COVENTRY
    To celebrate your father’s exequies. 176
    But is that wicked Gaveston return’d?

KING EDWARD

    Ay, priest, and lives to be reveng’d on thee,
    That wert the only cause of his exile.

GAVESTON

    ’Tis true; and but for reverence of these robes, 180
    Thou should’st not plod one foot beyond this place.

BISHOP OF COVENTRY

    I did no more than I was bound to do;
    And, Gaveston, unless thou be reclaim’d,
    As then I did incense the parliament, 184
    So will I now, and thou shalt back to France.

GAVESTON

    Saving your reverence, you must pardon me.

KING EDWARD

    Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole,
    And in the channel 10 christen him anew. 188

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Ah, brother, lay not violent hands on him!
    For he’ll complain unto the see of Rome.

GAVESTON

    Let him complain unto the see of hell;
    I’ll be reveng’d on him for my exile. 192

KING EDWARD

    No, spare his life, but seize upon his goods.
    Be thou lord bishop and receive his rents,
    And make him serve thee as thy chaplain.
    I give him thee—here, use him as thou wilt. 196

GAVESTON

    He shall to prison, and there die in bolts.

KING EDWARD

    Ay, to the Tower, the Fleet, or where thou wilt.

BISHOP OF COVENTRY

    For this offence, be thou accurst of God!

KING EDWARD

    Who’s there? Convey this priest to the Tower. 200

BISHOP OF COVENTRY

    True, true.

KING EDWARD

    But in the meantime, Gaveston, away,
    And take possession of his house and goods.
    Come, follow me, and thou shalt have my guard 204
    To see it done, and bring thee safe again.

GAVESTON

    What should a priest do with so fair a house?
    A prison may best beseem his holiness. 

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    ’Tis true, the bishop is in the Tower,
    And goods and body given to Gaveston.

LANCASTER

    What! will they tyrannise upon the church?
    Ah, wicked king! accursed Gaveston! 4
    This ground, which is corrupted with their steps,
    Shall be their timeless 1 sepulchre or mine.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Well, let that peevish Frenchman guard him sure;
    Unless his breast be sword-proof he shall die. 8

ELDER MORTIMER

    How now! why droops the Earl of Lancaster?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Wherefore is Guy of Warwick discontent?

LANCASTER

    That villain Gaveston is made an earl.

ELDER MORTIMER

    An earl! 12

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Ay, and besides Lord Chamberlain of the realm,
    And Secretary too, and Lord of Man.

ELDER MORTIMER

    We may not, nor we will not suffer this.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Why post we not from hence to levy men? 16

LANCASTER

    “My Lord of Cornwall” now at every word!
    And happy is the man whom he vouchsafes,
    For vailing of his bonnet, 2 one good look.
    Thus, arm in arm, the king and he doth march: 20
    Nay more, the guard upon his lordship waits;
    And all the court begins to flatter him.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Thus leaning on the shoulder of the king,
    He nods and scorns and smiles at those that pass. 24

ELDER MORTIMER

    Doth no man take exceptions at the slave?

LANCASTER

    All stomach 3 him, but none dare speak a word.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Ah, that bewrays their baseness, Lancaster!
    Were all the earls and barons of my mind, 28
    We’ll hale him from the bosom of the king,
    And at the court-gate hang the peasant up,
    Who, swoln with venom of ambitious pride,
    Will be the ruin of the realm and us. 32

[Enter the ARCHBISHOP of CANTERBURY (and an Attendant)]

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Here comes my lord of Canterbury’s grace.

LANCASTER

    His countenance bewrays 4 he is displeas’d.

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    First were his sacred garments rent and torn,
    Then laid they violent hands upon him; next 36
    Himself imprisoned, and his goods asseiz’d:
    This certify the Pope;—away, take horse. [Exit Attendant]

LANCASTER

    My lord, will you take arms against the king?

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    What need I? God himself is up in arms, 40
    When violence is offered to the church.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Then will you join with us, that be his peers,
    To banish or behead that Gaveston?

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    What else, my lords? for it concerns me near; 44
    The bishopric of Coventry is his.

[Enter QUEEN ISABELLA]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Madam, whither walks your majesty so fast?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Unto the forest, gentle Mortimer,
    To live in grief and baleful discontent; 48
    For now, my lord, the king regards me not,
    But doats upon the love of Gaveston.
    He claps his cheeks, and hangs about his neck,
    Smiles in his face, and whispers in his ears; 52
    And when I come he frowns, as who should say,
    “Go whither thou wilt, seeing I have Gaveston.”

ELDER MORTIMER

    Is it not strange that he is thus bewitch’d?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Madam, return unto the court again. 56
    That sly inveigling Frenchman we’ll exile,
    Or lose our lives; and yet, ere that day come,
    The king shall lose his crown; for we have power,
    And courage too, to be reveng’d at full. 60

QUEEN ISABELLA

    But yet lift not your swords against the king.

LANCASTER

    No; but we will lift Gaveston from hence.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    And war must be the means, or he’ll stay still.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Then let him stay; for rather than my lord 64
    Shall be oppress’d with civil mutinies,
    I will endure a melancholy life,
    And let him frolic with his minion.

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    My lords, to ease all this, but hear me speak:— 68
    We and the rest, that are his counsellors,
    Will meet, and with a general consent
    Confirm his banishment with our hands and seals.

LANCASTER

    What we confirm the king will frustrate. 72

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Then may we lawfully revolt from him.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    But say, my lord, where shall this meeting be?

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    At the New Temple.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Content. 76

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    And, in the meantime, I’ll entreat you all
    To cross to Lambeth, and there stay with me.

LANCASTER

    Come then, let’s away.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Madam, farewell! 80

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Farewell, sweet Mortimer; and, for my sake,
    Forbear to levy arms against the king.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Ay, if words will serve; if not, I must. 

GAVESTON

    Edmund, the mighty Prince of Lancaster,
    That hath more earldoms than an ass can bear,
    And both the Mortimers, two goodly men,
    With Guy of Warwick, that redoubted knight, 4
    Are gone toward Lambeth—there let them remain!

LANCASTER

    Here is the form of Gaveston’s exile:
    May it please your lordship to subscribe your name.

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    Give me the paper. [He subscribes, as do the others after him.]

LANCASTER

    Quick, quick, my lord; I long to write my name. 4

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    But I long more to see him banish’d hence.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    The name of Mortimer shall fright the king,
    Unless he be declin’d from that base peasant.

[Enter KING EDWARD, GAVESTON, (and KENT)]

KING EDWARD

    What, are you mov’d that Gaveston sits here? 8
    It is our pleasure; we will have it so.

LANCASTER

    Your grace doth well to place him by your side,
    For nowhere else the new earl is so safe.

ELDER MORTIMER

    What man of noble birth can brook this sight? 12
    Quam male conveniunt! 1
    See what a scornful look the peasant casts!

PEMBROKE

    Can kingly lions fawn on creeping ants?

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Ignoble vassal, that like Phaeton 16
    Aspir’st unto the guidance of the sun!

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Their downfall is at hand, their forces down;
    We will not thus be fac’d and over-peer’d.

KING EDWARD

    Lay hands on that traitor Mortimer! 20

ELDER MORTIMER

    Lay hands on that traitor Gaveston!

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Is this the duty that you owe your king?

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    We know our duties—let him know his peers.

KING EDWARD

    Whither will you bear him? Stay, or ye shall die. 24

ELDER MORTIMER

    We are no traitors; therefore threaten not.

GAVESTON

    No, threaten not, my lord, but pay them home!
    Were I a king—

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Thou villain, wherefore talk’st thou of a king, 28
    That hardly art a gentleman by birth?

KING EDWARD

    Were he a peasant, being my minion,
    I’ll make the proudest of you stoop to him.

LANCASTER

    My lord, you may not thus disparage us.— 32
    Away, I say, with hateful Gaveston!

ELDER MORTIMER

    And with the Earl of Kent that favours him.

[Attendants remove KENT and GAVESTON.] KING EDWARD

    Nay, then, lay violent hands upon your king.
    Here, Mortimer, sit thou in Edward’s throne; 36
    Warwick and Lancaster, wear you my crown.
    Was ever king thus over-rul’d as I?

LANCASTER

    Learn then to rule us better, and the realm.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    What we have done, our heart-blood shall maintain. 40

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Think you that we can brook this upstart pride?

KING EDWARD

    Anger and wrathful fury stops my speech.

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    Why are you mov’d? Be patient, my lord,
    And see what we your counsellors have done. 44

YOUNG MORTIMER

    My lords, now let us all be resolute,
    And either have our wills, or lose our lives.

KING EDWARD

    Meet you for this, proud overbearing peers?
    Ere my sweet Gaveston shall part from me, 48
    This isle shall fleet 2 upon the ocean,
    And wander to the unfrequented Inde.

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    You know that I am legate to the Pope.
    On your allegiance to the see of Rome, 52
    Subscribe, as we have done, to his exile.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Curse him, if he refuse; and then may we
    Depose him and elect another king.

KING EDWARD

    Ay, there it goes! but yet I will not yield. 56
    Curse me, depose me, do the worst you can.

LANCASTER

    Then linger not, my lord, but do it straight.

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    Remember how the bishop was abus’d!
    Either banish him that was the cause thereof, 60
    Or I will presently discharge these lords
    Of duty and allegiance due to thee.

KING EDWARD[Aside.]

    It boots me not to threat; I must speak fair.—
    The legate of the Pope will be obey’d. 64
    My lord, you shall be Chancellor of the realm;
    Thou, Lancaster, High Admiral of our fleet;
    Young Mortimer and his uncle shall be earls;
    And you, Lord Warwick, President of the North; 68
    And thou, of Wales. If this content you not,
    Make several kingdoms of this monarchy,
    And share it equally amongst you all,
    So I may have some nook or corner left, 72
    To frolic with my dearest Gaveston.

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    Nothing shall alter us, we are resolv’d.

LANCASTER

    Come, come, subscribe.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Why should you love him whom the world hates so? 76

KING EDWARD

    Because he loves me more than all the world.
    Ah, none but rude and savage-minded men
    Would seek the ruin of my Gaveston;
    You that be noble-born should pity him. 80

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    You that are princely-born should shake him off.
    For shame subscribe, and let the lown 3 depart.

ELDER MORTIMER

    Urge him, my lord.

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    Are you content to banish him the realm? 84

KING EDWARD

    I see I must, and therefore am content.
    Instead of ink, I’ll write it with my tears. [Subscribes.]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    The king is love-sick for his minion.

KING EDWARD

    ’Tis done; and now, accursed hand, fall off! 88

LANCASTER

    Give it me; I’ll have it publish’d in the streets.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    I’ll see him presently despatch’d away.

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    Now is my heart at ease.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    And so is mine. 92

PEMBROKE

    This will be good news to the common sort.

ELDER MORTIMER

    Be it or no, he shall not linger here.

[Exeunt all except KING EDWARD.] KING EDWARD

    How fast they run to banish him I love!
    They would not stir, were it to do me good. 96
    Why should a king be subject to a priest?
    Proud Rome! that hatchest such imperial grooms,
    For these thy superstitious taper-lights,
    Wherewith thy antichristian churches blaze, 100
    I’ll fire thy crazed buildings, and enforce
    The papal towers to kiss the lowly ground!
    With slaughtered priests make Tiber’s channel swell,
    And banks rais’d higher with their sepulchres! 104
    As for the peers, that back the clergy thus,
    If I be king, not one of them shall live.

[Re-enter GAVESTON]

GAVESTON

    My lord, I hear it whispered everywhere,
    That I am banish’d, and must fly the land. 108

KING EDWARD

    ’Tis true, sweet Gaveston—O! were it false!
    The legate of the Pope will have it so,
    And thou must hence, or I shall be depos’d.
    But I will reign to be reveng’d of them; 112
    And therefore, sweet friend, take it patiently.
    Live where thou wilt, I’ll send thee gold enough;
    And long thou shalt not stay, or if thou dost,
    I’ll come to thee; my love shall ne’er decline. 116

GAVESTON

    Is all my hope turn’d to this hell of grief?

KING EDWARD

    Rend not my heart with thy too-piercing words:
    Thou from this land, I from myself am banish’d.

GAVESTON

    To go from hence grieves not poor Gaveston; 120
    But to forsake you, in whose gracious looks
    The blessedness of Gaveston remains,
    For nowhere else seeks he felicity.

KING EDWARD

    And only this torments my wretched soul 124
    That, whether I will or no, thou must depart.
    Be governor of Ireland in my stead,
    And there abide till fortune call thee home.
    Here take my picture, and let me wear thine; [They exchange pictures.] 128
    O, might I keep thee here as I do this,
    Happy were I! but now most miserable!

GAVESTON

    ’Tis something to be pitied of a king.

KING EDWARD

    Thou shalt not hence—I’ll hide thee, Gaveston. 132

GAVESTON

    I shall be found, and then ’twill grieve me more.

KING EDWARD

    Kind words and mutual talk makes our grief greater;
    Therefore, with dumb embracement, let us part.—
    Stay, Gaveston, I cannot leave thee thus. 136

GAVESTON

    For every look, my lord 4 drops down a tear.
    Seeing I must go, do not renew my sorrow.

KING EDWARD

    The time is little that thou hast to stay,
    And, therefore, give me leave to look my fill. 140
    But come, sweet friend, I’ll bear thee on thy way.

GAVESTON

    The peers will frown.

KING EDWARD

    I pass 5 not for their anger—Come, let’s go;
    O that we might as well return as go. 144

[Enter EDMUND and QUEEN ISABELLA]

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Whither goes my lord?

KING EDWARD

    Fawn not on me, French strumpet! Get thee gone!

QUEEN ISABELLA

    On whom but on my husband should I fawn?

GAVESTON

    On Mortimer! with whom, ungentle queen— 148
    I say no more. Judge you the rest, my lord.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    In saying this, thou wrong’st me, Gaveston.
    Is’t not enough that thou corrupt’st my lord,
    And art a bawd to his affections, 152
    But thou must call mine honour thus in question?

GAVESTON

    I mean not so; your grace must pardon me.

KING EDWARD

    Thou art too familiar with that Mortimer,
    And by thy means is Gaveston exil’d; 156
    But I would wish thee reconcile the lords,
    Or thou shalt ne’er be reconcil’d to me.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Your highness knows it lies not in my power.

KING EDWARD

    Away then! touch me not.—Come, Gaveston. 160

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Villain! ’tis thou that robb’st me of my lord.

GAVESTON

    Madam, ’tis you that rob me of my lord.

KING EDWARD

    Speak not unto her; let her droop and pine.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Wherein, my lord, have I deserv’d these words? 164
    Witness the tears that Isabella sheds,
    Witness this heart, that, sighing for thee, breaks,
    How dear my lord is to poor Isabel.

KING EDWARD

    And witness Heaven how dear thou art to me! 168
    There weep; for till my Gaveston be repeal’d,
    Assure thyself thou com’st not in my sight.

[Exeunt EDWARD and GAVESTON.]

QUEEN ISABELLA

    O miserable and distressed queen!
    Would, when I left sweet France and was embark’d, 172
    That charming Circe, walking on the waves,
    Had chang’d my shape, or at the marriage-day
    The cup of Hymen had been full of poison,
    Or with those arms that twin’d about my neck 176
    I had been stifled, and not liv’d to see
    The king my lord thus to abandon me!
    Like frantic Juno will I fill the earth
    With ghastly murmur of my sighs and cries; 180
    For never doated Jove on Ganymede
    So much as he on cursed Gaveston.
    But that will more exasperate his wrath;
    I must entreat him, I must speak him fair, 184
    And be a means to call home Gaveston.
    And yet he’ll ever doat on Gaveston;
    And so am I for ever miserable.

[Re-enter LANCASTER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, the Elder MORTIMER, and Young MORTIMER]

LANCASTER

    Look where the sister of the King of France 188
    Sits wringing of her hands, and beats her breast!

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    The king, I fear, hath ill-entreated her.

PEMBROKE

    Hard is the heart that injures such a saint.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    I know ’tis ’long of Gaveston she weeps. 192

ELDER MORTIMER

    Why? He is gone.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Madam, how fares your grace?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Ah, Mortimer! now breaks the king’s hate forth,
    And he confesseth that he loves me not. 196

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Cry quittance, madam, then; and love not him.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    No, rather will I die a thousand deaths!
    And yet I love in vain;—he’ll ne’er love me.

LANCASTER

    Fear ye not, madam; now his minion’s gone, 200
    His wanton humour will be quickly left.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    O never, Lancaster! I am enjoin’d
    To sue upon you all for his repeal;
    This wills my lord, and this must I perform, 204
    Or else be banish’d from his highness’ presence.

LANCASTER

    For his repeal? Madam, he comes not back,
    Unless the sea cast up his shipwreck’d body.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    And to behold so sweet a sight as that, 208
    There’s none here but would run his horse to death.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    But, madam, would you have us call him home?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Ay, Mortimer, for till he be restor’d,
    The angry king hath banish’d me the court; 212
    And, therefore, as thou lov’st and tend’rest me,
    Be thou my advocate unto these peers.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    What! would you have me plead for Gaveston?

ELDER MORTIMER

    Plead for him he that will, I am resolv’d. 216

LANCASTER

    And so am I, my lord. Dissuade the queen.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    O Lancaster! let him dissuade the king,
    For ’tis against my will he should return.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Then speak not for him, let the peasant go. 220

QUEEN ISABELLA

    ’Tis for myself I speak, and not for him.

PEMBROKE

    No speaking will prevail, and therefore cease.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Fair queen, forbear to angle for the fish
    Which, being caught, strikes him that takes it dead; 224
    I mean that vile torpedo, Gaveston,
    That now, I hope, floats on the Irish seas.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Sweet Mortimer, sit down by me awhile,
    And I will tell thee reasons of such weight 228
    As thou wilt soon subscribe to his repeal.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    It is impossible; but speak your mind.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Then thus, but none shall hear it but ourselves.

[Talks to Young MORTIMER apart.]

LANCASTER

    My lords, albeit the queen win Mortimer, 232
    Will you be resolute, and hold with me?

ELDER MORTIMER

    Not I, against my nephew.

PEMBROKE

    Fear not, the queen’s words cannot alter him.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    No? Do but mark how earnestly she pleads! 236

LANCASTER

    And see how coldly his looks make denial!

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    She smiles; now for my life his mind is chang’d!

LANCASTER

    I’ll rather lose his friendship, I, than grant.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Well, of necessity it must be so. 240
    My lords, that I abhor base Gaveston,
    I hope your honours make no question,
    And therefore, though I plead for his repeal,
    ’Tis not for his sake, but for our avail; 244
    Nay for the realm’s behoof, and for the king’s.

LANCASTER

    Fie, Mortimer, dishonour not thyself!
    Can this be true, ’twas good to banish him?
    And is this true, to call him home again? 248
    Such reasons make white black, and dark night day.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    My lord of Lancaster, mark the respect. 6

LANCASTER

    In no respect can contraries be true.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Yet, good my lord, hear what he can allege. 252

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    All that he speaks is nothing; we are resolv’d.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Do you not wish that Gaveston were dead?

PEMBROKE

    I would he were!

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Why, then, my lord, give me but leave to speak. 256

ELDER MORTIMER

    But, nephew, do not play the sophister.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    This which I urge is of a burning zeal
    To mend the king, and do our country good.
    Know you not Gaveston hath store of gold, 260
    Which may in Ireland purchase him such friends
    As he will front the mightest of us all?
    And whereas he shall live and be belov’d,
    ’Tis hard for us to work his overthrow. 264

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Mark you but that, my lord of Lancaster.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    But were he here, detested as he is,
    How easily might some base slave be suborn’d
    To greet his lordship with a poniard, 268
    And none so much as blame the murderer,
    But rather praise him for that brave attempt,
    And in the chronicle enrol his name
    For purging of the realm of such a plague! 272

PEMBROKE

    He saith true.

LANCASTER

    Ay, but how chance this was not done before?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Because, my lords, it was not thought upon.
    Nay, more, when he shall know it lies in us 276
    To banish him, and then to call him home,
    ’Twill make him vail 7 the top-flag of his pride,
    And fear to offend the meanest nobleman.

ELDER MORTIMER

    But how if he do not, nephew? 280

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Then may we with some colour rise in arms;
    For howsoever we have borne it out,
    ’Tis treason to be up against the king.
    So we shall have the people of our side, 284
    Which for his father’s sake lean to the king,
    But cannot brook a night-grown mushroom,
    Such a one as my lord of Cornwall is,
    Should bear us down of the nobility. 288
    And when the commons and the nobles join,
    ’Tis not the king can buckler Gaveston;
    We’ll pull him from the strongest hold he hath.
    My lords, if to perform this I be slack, 292
    Think me as base a groom as Gaveston.

LANCASTER

    On that condition, Lancaster will grant.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    And so will Pembroke and I.

ELDER MORTIMER

    And I. 296

YOUNG MORTIMER

    In this I count me highly gratified,
    And Mortimer will rest at your command.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    And when this favour Isabel forgets,
    Then let her live abandon’d and forlorn.— 300
    But see, in happy time, my lord the king,
    Having brought the Earl of Cornwall on his way,
    Is new return’d. This news will glad him much,
    Yet not so much as me. I love him more 304
    Than he can Gaveston; would he lov’d me
    But half so much, then were I treble-bless’d.

[Re-enter KING EDWARD, mourning]

KING EDWARD

    He’s gone, and for his absence thus I mourn.
    Did never sorrow go so near my heart 308
    As doth the want of my sweet Gaveston;
    And could my crown’s revenue bring him back,
    I would freely give it to his enemies,
    And think I gain’d, having bought so dear a friend. 312

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Hark! how he harps upon his minion.

KING EDWARD

    My heart is as an anvil unto sorrow,
    Which beats upon it like the Cyclops’ hammers,
    And with the noise turns up my giddy brain, 316
    And makes me frantic for my Gaveston.
    Ah! had some bloodless Fury rose from hell,
    And with my kingly sceptre struck me dead,
    When I was forc’d to leave my Gaveston! 320

LANCASTER

    Diablo! What passions call you these?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    My gracious lord, I come to bring you news.

KING EDWARD

    That you have parley’d with your Mortimer!

QUEEN ISABELLA

    That Gaveston, my lord, shall be repeal’d. 324

KING EDWARD

    Repeal’d! The news is too sweet to be true?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    But will you love me, if you find it so?

KING EDWARD

    If it be so, what will not Edward do?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    For Gaveston, but not for Isabel. 328

KING EDWARD

    For thee, fair queen, if thou lov’st Gaveston.
    I’ll hang a golden tongue about thy neck,
    Seeing thou hast pleaded with so good success.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    No other jewels hang about my neck 332
    Than these, my lord; nor let me have more wealth
    Than I may fetch from this rich treasury.
    O how a kiss revives poor Isabel!

KING EDWARD

    Once more receive my hand; and let this be 336
    A second marriage ’twixt thyself and me.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    And may it prove more happy than the first!
    My gentle lord, bespeak these nobles fair,
    That wait attendance for a gracious look, 340
    And on their knees salute your majesty.

KING EDWARD

    Courageous Lancaster, embrace thy king!
    And, as gross vapours perish by the sun,
    Even so let hatred with thy sovereign’s smile. 344
    Live thou with me as my companion.
    LANCASTER
    This salutation overjoys my heart.

KING EDWARD

    Warwick shall be my chiefest counsellor:
    These silver hairs will more adorn my court 348
    Than gaudy silks, or rich embroidery.
    Chide me, sweet Warwick, if I go astray.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Slay me, my lord, when I offend your grace.

KING EDWARD

    In solemn triumphs, and in public shows, 352
    Pembroke shall bear the sword before the king.

PEMBROKE

    And with this sword Pembroke will fight for you.

KING EDWARD

    But wherefore walks young Mortimer aside?
    Be thou commander of our royal fleet; 356
    Or, if that lofty office like thee not,
    I make thee here Lord Marshal of the realm.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    My lord, I’ll marshal so your enemies,
    As England shall be quiet, and you safe. 360

KING EDWARD

    And as for you, Lord Mortimer of Chirke,
    Whose great achievements in our foreign war
    Deserves no common place nor mean reward,
    Be you the general of the levied troops, 364
    That now are ready to assail the Scots.

ELDER MORTIMER

    In this your grace hath highly honoured me,
    For with my nature war doth best agree.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Now is the King of England rich and strong, 368
    Having the love of his renowned peers.

KING EDWARD

    Ay, Isabel, ne’er was my heart so light.
    Clerk of the crown, direct our warrant forth
    For Gaveston to Ireland: 372

[Enter BEAUMONT with warrant.]

    Beaumont, fly
    As fast as Iris or Jove’s Mercury.

BEAUMONT

    It shall be done, my gracious lord.

[Exit.] KING EDWARD

    Lord Mortimer, we leave you to your charge. 376
    Now let us in, and feast it royally.
    Against our friend the Earl of Cornwall comes,
    We’ll have a general tilt and tournament;
    And then his marriage shall be solemnis’d. 380
    For wot you not that I have made him sure 8
    Unto our cousin, the Earl of Gloucester’s heir?

LANCASTER

    Such news we hear, my lord.

KING EDWARD

    That day, if not for him, yet for my sake, 384
    Who in the triumph will be challenger,
    Spare for no cost; we will requit your love.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    In this, or aught, your highness shall command us.

KING EDWARD

    Thanks, gentle Warwick: come, let’s in and revel. 388

[Exeunt all except the MORTIMERS.] ELDER MORTIMER

    Nephew, I must to Scotland; thou stayest here.
    Leave now t’oppose thyself against the king.
    Thou seest by nature he is mild and calm,
    And, seeing his mind so doats on Gaveston, 392
    Let him without controlment have his will.
    The mightiest kings have had their minions:
    Great Alexander loved Hephestion;
    The conquering Hercules 9 for Hylas wept; 396
    And for Patroclus stern Achilles drooped
    And not kings only, but the wisest men:
    The Roman Tully lov’d Octavius;
    Grave Socrates, wild Alcibiades. 400
    Then let his grace, whose youth is flexible,
    And promiseth as much as we can wish,
    Freely enjoy that vain, light-headed earl;
    For riper years will wean him from such toys. 404

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Uncle, his wanton humour grieves not me;
    But this I scorn, that one so basely born
    Should by his sovereign’s favour grow so pert,
    And riot it with the treasure of the realm. 408
    While soldiers mutiny for want of pay,
    He wears a lord’s revenue on his back,
    And Midas-like, he jets 10 it in the court,
    With base outlandish cullions 11 at his heels, 412
    Whose proud fantastic liveries make such show
    As if that Proteus, god of shapes, appear’d.
    I have not seen a dapper Jack so brisk;
    He wears a short Italian hooded cloak 416
    Larded with pearl, and, in his Tuscan cap,
    A jewel of more value than the crown.
    While others walk below, the king and he
    From out a window laugh at such as we, 420
    And flout our train, and jest at our attire.
    Uncle, ’tis this that makes me impatient.

ELDER MORTIMER

    But, nephew, now you see the king is chang’d.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Then so am I, and live to do him service: 424
    But whiles I have a sword, a hand, a heart,
    I will not yield to any such upstart.
    You know my mind; come, uncle, let’s away. 

BALDOCK

    Spencer,
    Seeing that our lord the Earl of Gloucester’s dead,
    Which of the nobles dost thou mean to serve?

YOUNG SPENCER

    Not Mortimer, nor any of his side, 4
    Because the king and he are enemies.
    Baldock, learn this of me, a factious lord
    Shall hardly do himself good, much less us;
    But he that hath the favour of a king, 8
    May with one word advance us while we live.
    The liberal Earl of Cornwall is the man
    On whose good fortune Spencer’s hopes depends.

BALDOCK

    What, mean you then to be his follower? 12

YOUNG SPENCER

    No, his companion; for he loves me well,
    And would have once preferr’d me to the king.

BALDOCK

    But he is banish’d; there’s small hope of him.

YOUNG SPENCER

    Ay, for a while; but, Baldock, mark the end. 16
    A friend of mine told me in secrecy
    That he’s repeal’d, and sent for back again;
    And even now a post came from the court
    With letters to our lady from the king; 20
    And as she read she smil’d, which makes me think
    It is about her lover Gaveston.

BALDOCK

    ’Tis like enough; for since he was exil’d
    She neither walks abroad, nor comes in sight. 24
    But I had thought the match had been broke off,
    And that his banishment had chang’d her mind.

YOUNG SPENCER

    Our lady’s first love is not wavering;
    My life for thine, she will have Gaveston. 28

BALDOCK

    Then hope I by her means to be preferr’d,
    Having read unto her since she was a child.

YOUNG SPENCER

    Then, Baldock, you must cast the scholar off,
    And learn to court it like a gentleman. 32
    ’Tis not a black coat and a little band,
    A velvet-cap’d coat, fac’d before with serge,
    And smelling to a nosegay all the day,
    Or holding of a napkin in your hand, 36
    Or saying a long grace at a table’s end,
    Or making low legs 1 to a nobleman,
    Or looking downward with your eyelids close,
    And saying, “Truly, an’t 2 may please your honour,” 40
    Can get you any favour with great men;
    You must be proud, bold, pleasant, resolute,
    And now and then stab, as occasion serves.

BALDOCK

    Spencer, thou know’st I hate such formal toys, 44
    And use them but of mere hypocrisy.
    Mine old lord whiles he liv’d was so precise,
    That he would take exceptions at my buttons,
    And being like pin’s heads, blame me for the bigness; 48
    Which made me curate-like in mine attire,
    Though inwardly licentious enough
    And apt for any kind of villainy.
    I am none of these common pedants, I, 52
    That cannot speak without propterea quod.

YOUNG SPENCER

    But one of those that saith quandoquidem,
    And hath a special gift to form a verb.

BALDOCK

    Leave off this jesting, here my lady comes. 56

[Enter the Lady (KING EDWARD’S Niece.)]

NIECE

    The grief for his exile was not so much
    As is the joy of his returning home.
    This letter came from my sweet Gaveston:—
    What need’st thou, love, thus to excuse thyself? 60
    I know thou could’st not come and visit me.

[Reads.]

    “I will not long be from thee, though I die.”
    This argues the entire love of my lord;

[Reads.]

    “When I forsake thee, death seize on my heart:” 64
    But stay thee here where Gaveston shall sleep.

[Puts the letter into her bosom.]

    Now to the letter of my lord the king.—
    He wills me to repair unto the court, 68
    And meet my Gaveston? Why do I stay,
    Seeing that he talks thus of my marriage-day?
    Who’s there? Baldock!
    See that my coach be ready, I must hence. 72

BALDOCK

    It shall be done, madam.

NIECE

    And meet me at the park-pale presently.

[Exit BALDOCK.]

    Spencer, stay you and bear me company,
    For I have joyful news to tell thee of. 76
    My lord of Cornwall is a-coming over,
    And will be at the court as soon as we.

YOUNG SPENCER

    I knew the king would have him home again.

NIECE

    If all things sort out as I hope they will, 80
    Thy service, Spencer, shall be thought upon.

YOUNG SPENCER

    I humbly thank your ladyship.

NIECE

    Come, lead the way; I long till I am there. 

KING EDWARD

    The wind is good, I wonder why he stays;
    I fear me he is wrack’d upon the sea.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Look, Lancaster, how passionate 1 he is,
    And still his mind runs on his minion! 4

LANCASTER

    My lord,—

KING EDWARD

    How now! what news? Is Gaveston arriv’d?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Nothing but Gaveston!—What means your grace?
    You have matters of more weight to think upon; 8
    The King of France sets foot in Normandy.

KING EDWARD

    A trifle! we’ll expel him when we please.
    But tell me, Mortimer, what’s thy device
    Against the stately triumph we decreed? 12

YOUNG MORTIMER

    A homely one, my lord, not worth the telling.

KING EDWARD

    Pray thee let me know it.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    But, seeing you are so desirous, thus it is:
    A lofty cedar-tree, fair flourishing, 16
    On whose top-branches kingly eagles perch,
    And by the bark a canker 2 creeps me up,
    And gets into the highest bough of all:
    The motto, Æque tandem. 3 20

KING EDWARD

    And what is yours, my lord of Lancaster?

LANCASTER

    My lord, mine’s more obscure than Mortimer’s.
    Pliny reports there is a flying fish
    Which all the other fishes deadly hate, 24
    And therefore, being pursued, it takes the air:
    No sooner is it up, but there’s a fowl
    That seizeth it; this fish, my lord, I bear:
    The motto this: Undique mors est. 28

KING EDWARD

    Proud Mortimer! ungentle Lancaster!
    Is this the love you bear your sovereign?
    Is this the fruit your reconcilement bears?
    Can you in words make show of amity, 32
    And in your shields display your rancorous minds!
    What call you this but private libelling
    Against the Earl of Cornwall and my brother?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Sweet husband, be content, they all love you. 36

KING EDWARD

    They love me not that hate my Gaveston.
    I am that cedar, shake me not too much;
    And you the eagles; soar ye ne’er so high,
    I have the jesses that will pull you down; 40
    And Æque tandem shall that canker cry
    Unto the proudest peer of Britainy.
    Though thou compar’st him to a flying fish,
    And threatenest death whether he rise or fall, 44
    ’Tis not the hugest monster of the sea,
    Nor foulest harpy that shall swallow him.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    If in his absence thus he favours him,
    What will he do whenas he shall be present? 48

LANCASTER

    That shall we see; look where his lordship comes.

[Enter GAVESTON]

KING EDWARD

    My Gaveston!
    Welcome to Tynemouth! Welcome to thy friend!
    Thy absence made me droop and pine away; 52
    For, as the lovers of fair Danae,
    When she was lock’d up in a brazen tower,
    Desired her more, and wax’d outrageous,
    So did it fare with me; and now thy sight 56
    Is sweeter far than was thy parting hence
    Bitter and irksome to my sobbing heart.

GAVESTON

    Sweet lord and king, your speech preventeth 7 mine,
    Yet have I words left to express my joy: 60
    The shepherd nipt with biting winter’s rage
    Frolics not more to see the painted spring,
    Than I do to behold your majesty.

KING EDWARD

    Will none of you salute my Gaveston? 64

LANCASTER

    Salute him? yes. Welcome, Lord Chamberlain!

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Welcome is the good Earl of Cornwall!

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Welcome, Lord Governor of the Isle of Man!

PEMBROKE

    Welcome, Master Secretary! 68

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Brother, do you hear them?

KING EDWARD

    Still will these earls and barons use me thus.

GAVESTON

    My lord, I cannot brook these injuries.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Aye me, poor soul, when these begin to jar. [Aside.] 72

KING EDWARD

    Return it to their throats, I’ll be thy warrant.

GAVESTON

    Base, leaden earls, that glory in your birth,
    Go sit at home and eat your tenants’ beef;
    And come not here to scoff at Gaveston, 76
    Whose mounting thoughts did never creep so low
    As to bestow a look on such as you.

LANCASTER

    Yet I disdain not to do this for you. [Draws his sword and offers to stab GAVESTON.]

KING EDWARD

    Treason! treason! where’s the traitor? 80

PEMBROKE

    Here! here!

KING EDWARD

    Convey hence Gaveston; they’ll murder him.

GAVESTON

    The life of thee shall salve this foul disgrace.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Villain! thy life, unless I miss mine aim. [Wounds GAVESTON.] 84

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Ah! furious Mortimer, what hast thou done?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    No more than I would answer, were he slain. [Exit GAVESTON with Attendants.]

KING EDWARD

    Yes, more than thou canst answer, though he live.
    Dear shall you both abye this riotous deed. 88
    Out of my presence! Come not near the court.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    I’ll not be barr’d the court for Gaveston.

LANCASTER

    We’ll hale him by the ears unto the block.

KING EDWARD

    Look to your own heads; his is sure enough. 92

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Look to your own crown, if you back him thus.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Warwick, these words do ill beseem thy years.

KING EDWARD

    Nay, all of them conspire to cross me thus;
    But if I live, I’ll tread upon their heads 96
    That think with high looks thus to tread me down.
    Come, Edmund, let’s away and levy men,
    ’Tis war that must abate these barons’ pride.

[Exeunt KING EDWARD, (QUEEN ISABELLA and KENT.}] GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Let’s to our castles, for the king is mov’d. 100

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Mov’d may he be, and perish in his wrath!

LANCASTER

    Cousin, it is no dealing with him now,
    He means to make us stoop by force of arms;
    And therefore let us jointly here protest, 104
    To persecute that Gaveston to the death.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    By heaven, the abject villain shall not live!

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    I’ll have his blood, or die in seeking it.

PEMBROKE

    The like oath Pembroke takes. 108

LANCASTER

    And so doth Lancaster.
    Now send our heralds to defy the king;
    And make the people swear to put him down.

[Enter a Messenger]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Letters! From whence? 112

MESSENGER

    From Scotland, my lord. [Giving letters to MORTIMER.]

LANCASTER

    Why, how now, cousin, how fares all our friends?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    My uncle’s taken prisoner by the Scots.

LANCASTER

    We’ll have him ransom’d, man; be of good cheer. 116

YOUNG MORTIMER

    They rate his ransom at five thousand pound.
    Who should defray the money but the king,
    Seeing he is taken prisoner in his wars?
    I’ll to the king. 120

LANCASTER

    Do, cousin, and I’ll bear thee company.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Meantime, my lord of Pembroke and myself
    Will to Newcastle here, and gather head. 9

YOUNG MORTIMER

    About it then, and we will follow you. 124

LANCASTER

    Be resolute and full of secrecy.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    I warrant you.

[Exit with PEMBROKE.] YOUNG MORTIMER

    Cousin, and if he will not ransom him,
    I’ll thunder such a peal into his ears, 128
    As never subject did unto his king.

LANCASTER

    Content, I’ll bear my part—Holla! who’s there?

[Enter Guard]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Ay, marry, such a guard as this doth well.

LANCASTER

    Lead on the way. 132

GUARD

    Whither will your lordships?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Whither else but to the king.

GUARD

    His highness is dispos’d to be alone.

LANCASTER

    Why, so he may, but we will speak to him. 136

GUARD

    You may not in, my lord.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    May we not?

[Enter KING EDWARD and KENT]

KING EDWARD

    How now!
    What noise is this? Who have we there? Is’t you? [Going.] 140

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Nay, stay, my lord, I come to bring you news;
    Mine uncle’s taken prisoner by the Scots.

KING EDWARD

    Then ransom him.

LANCASTER

    ’Twas in your wars; you should ransom him. 144

YOUNG MORTIMER

    And you shall ransom him, or else——s

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    What! Mortimer, you will not threaten him?

KING EDWARD

    Quiet yourself, you shall have the broad seal,
    To gather for him throughout the realm. 148

LANCASTER

    Your minion Gaveston hath taught you this.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    My lord, the family of the Mortimers
    Are not so poor, but, would they sell their land,
    ’Twould levy men enough to anger you. 152
    We never beg, but use such prayers as these.

KING EDWARD

    Shall I still be haunted thus?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Nay, now you’re here alone, I’ll speak my mind.

LANCASTER

    And so will I, and then, my lord, farewell. 156

YOUNG MORTIMER

    The idle triumphs, masks, lascivious shows,
    And prodigal gifts bestow’d on Gaveston,
    Have drawn thy treasury dry, and made thee weak;
    The murmuring commons, overstretched, break. 160

LANCASTER

    Look for rebellion, look to be depos’d.
    Thy garrisons are beaten out of France,
    And, lame and poor, lie groaning at the gates.
    The wild O’Neill, with swarms of Irish kerns, 10 164
    Lives uncontroll’d within the English pale.
    Unto the walls of York the Scots made road, 11
    And unresisted drave away rich spoils.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    The haughty Dane commands the narrow seas, 168
    While in the harbour ride thy ships unrigg’d.

LANCASTER

    What foreign prince sends thee ambassadors?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Who loves thee, but a sort of flatterers?

LANCASTER

    Thy gentle queen, sole sister to Valois, 172
    Complains that thou hast left her all forlorn.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Thy court is naked, being bereft of those
    That make a king seem glorious to the world;
    I mean the peers, whom thou should’st dearly love. 176
    Libels are cast again thee in the street;
    Ballads and rhymes made of thy overthrow.

LANCASTER

    The Northern borderers seeing their houses burnt,
    Their wives and children slain, run up and down, 180
    Cursing the name of thee and Gaveston.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    When wert thou in the field with banner spread,
    But once? and then thy soldiers marched like players,
    With garish robes, not armour; and thyself, 184
    Bedaub’d with gold, rode laughing at the rest,
    Nodding and shaking of thy spangled crest,
    Where women’s favours hung like labels down.

LANCASTER

    And therefore came it, that the fleering 13 Scots, 188
    To England’s high disgrace, have made this jig;

        “Maids of England, sore may you mourn,—
        For your lemans you have lost at Bannocksbourn,— 15
        With a heave and a ho!
        What weeneth the King of England,
        So soon to have won Scotland?—
        With a rombelow!”

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Wigmore shall fly, to set my uncle free.

LANCASTER

    And when ’tis gone, our swords shall purchase more.
    If ye be mov’d, revenge it as you can; 192
    Look next to see us with our ensigns spread.

[Exit with Young MORTIMER.]

KING EDWARD

    My swelling heart for very anger breaks!
    How oft have I been baited by these peers,
    And dare not be reveng’d, for their power is great! 196
    Yet, shall the crowing of these cockerels
    Affright a lion? Edward, unfold thy paws,
    And let their lives’ blood slake thy fury’s hunger.
    If I be cruel and grow tyrannous, 200
    Now let them thank themselves, and rue too late.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    My lord, I see your love to Gaveston
    Will be the ruin of the realm and you,
    For now the wrathful nobles threaten wars, 204
    And therefore, brother, banish him for ever.

KING EDWARD

    Art thou an enemy to my Gaveston?

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Ay, and it grieves me that I favoured him.

KING EDWARD

    Traitor, begone! whine thou with Mortimer. 208

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    So will I, rather than with Gaveston.

KING EDWARD

    Out of my sight, and trouble me no more!

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    No marvel though thou scorn thy noble peers,
    When I thy brother am rejected thus. 212

KING EDWARD

    Away!

[Exit KENT.]

    Poor Gaveston, that has no friend but me,
    Do what they can, we’ll live in Tynemouth here,
    And, so I walk with him about the walls, 216
    What care I though the earls begirt us round?—
    Here comes she that is cause of all these jars.

[Enter QUEEN ISABELLA with (KING EDWARD’S Niece, two) Ladies, (GAVESTON,) BALDOCK and Young SPENCER]

QUEEN ISABELLA

    My lord, ’tis thought the earls are up in arms.

KING EDWARD

    Ay, and ’tis likewise thought you favour ’em. 220

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Thus do you still suspect me without cause?

NIECE

    Sweet uncle! speak more kindly to the queen.

GAVESTON

    My lord, dissemble with her, speak her fair.

KING EDWARD

    Pardon me, sweet, I forgot myself. 224

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Your pardon is quickly got of Isabel.

KING EDWARD

    The younger Mortimer is grown so brave,
    That to my face he threatens civil wars.

GAVESTON

    Why do you not commit him to the Tower? 228

KING EDWARD

    I dare not, for the people love him well.

GAVESTON

    Why, then we’ll have him privily made away.

KING EDWARD

    Would Lancaster and he had both carous’d
    A bowl of poison to each other’s health! 232
    But let them go, and tell me what are these?

NIECE

    Two of my father’s servants whilst he liv’d,—
    May’st please your grace to entertain them now.

KING EDWARD

    Tell me, where wast thou born? What is thine arms? 236

BALDOCK

    My name is Baldock, and my gentry
    I fetch from Oxford, not from heraldry.

KING EDWARD

    The fitter art thou, Baldock, for my turn.
    Wait on me, and I’ll see thou shalt not want. 240

BALDOCK

    I humbly thank your majesty.

KING EDWARD

    Knowest thou him, Gaveston?

GAVESTON

    Ay, my lord;
    His name is Spencer, he is well allied; 244
    For my sake, let him wait upon your grace;
    Scarce shall you find a man of more desert.

KING EDWARD

    Then, Spencer, wait upon me; for his sake
    I’ll grace thee with a higher style ere long. 248

YOUNG SPENCER

    No greater titles happen unto me,
    Than to be favoured of your majesty!

KING EDWARD

    Cousin, this day shall be your marriage-feast.
    And, Gaveston, think that I love thee well, 252
    To wed thee to our niece, the only heir
    Unto the Earl of Gloucester late deceas’d.

GAVESTON

    I know, my lord, many will stomach me,
    But I respect neither their love nor hate. 256

KING EDWARD

    The headstrong barons shall not limit me;
    He that I list to favour shall be great.
    Come, let’s away; and when the marriage ends,
    Have at the rebels, and their ’complices!

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    My lords, of love to this our native land
    I come to join with you and leave the king;
    And in your quarrel and the realm’s behoof
    Will be the first that shall adventure life. 4

LANCASTER

    I fear me, you are sent of policy,
    To undermine us with a show of love.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    He is your brother, therefore have we cause
    To cast 1 the worst, and doubt of your revolt. 8

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Mine honour shall be hostage of my truth;
    If that will not suffice, farewell, my lords.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Stay, Edmund; never was Plantagenet
    False to his word, and therefore trust we thee. 12

PEMBROKE

    But what’s the reason you should leave him now?

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    I have inform’d the Earl of Lancaster.

LANCASTER

    And it sufficeth. Now, my lords, know this,
    That Gaveston is secretly arriv’d, 16
    And here in Tynemouth frolics with the king.
    Let us with these our followers scale the walls,
    And suddenly surprise them unawares.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    I’ll give the onset. 20

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    And I’ll follow thee.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    This tottered ensign of my ancestors
    Which swept the desert shore of that dead sea
    Whereof we got the name of Mortimer, 24
    Will I advance upon these castle-walls.
    Drums, strike alarum, raise them from their sport,
    And ring aloud the knell of Gaveston!

LANCASTER

    None be so hardy as to touch the king; 28
    But neither spare you Gaveston nor his friends. 

KING EDWARD

    O tell me, Spencer, where is Gaveston?

YOUNG SPENCER

    I fear he is slain, my gracious lord.

KING EDWARD

    No, here he comes; now let them spoil and kill.

[Enter QUEEN ISABELLA, KING EDWARD’S Niece, GAVESTON, and Nobles]

    Fly, fly, my lords, the earls have got the hold; 4
    Take shipping and away to Scarborough;
    Spencer and I will post away by land.

GAVESTON

    O stay, my lord, they will not injure you.

KING EDWARD

    I will not trust them; Gaveston, away! 8

GAVESTON

    Farewell, my lord.

KING EDWARD

    Lady, farewell.

NIECE

    Farewell, sweet uncle, till we meet again.

KING EDWARD

    Farewell, sweet Gaveston; and farewell, niece. 12

QUEEN ISABELLA

    No farewell to poor Isabel thy queen?

KING EDWARD

    Yes, yes, for Mortimer, your lover’s sake.

[Exeunt all but QUEEN ISABELLA.] QUEEN ISABELLA

    Heavens can witness I love none but you:
    From my embracements thus he breaks away. 16
    O that mine arms could close this isle about,
    That I might pull him to me where I would!
    Or that these tears that drizzle from mine eyes
    Had power to mollify his stony heart, 20
    That when I had him we might never part.

[Enter LANCASTER, WARWICK, Young MORTIMER, and others. Alarums]

LANCASTER

    I wonder how he scap’d!

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Who’s this? The queen!

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Ay, Mortimer, the miserable queen, 24
    Whose pining heart her inward sighs have blasted,
    And body with continual mourning wasted:
    These hands are tir’d with haling of my lord
    From Gaveston, from wicked Gaveston, 28
    And all in vain; for, when I speak him fair,
    He turns away, and smiles upon his minion.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Cease to lament, and tell us where’s the king?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    What would you with the king? Is’t him you seek? 32

LANCASTER

    No, madam, but that cursed Gaveston.
    Far be it from the thought of Lancaster
    To offer violence to his sovereign.
    We would but rid the realm of Gaveston: 36
    Tell us where he remains, and he shall die.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    He’s gone by water unto Scarborough;
    Pursue him quickly, and he cannot ’scape;
    The king hath left him, and his train is small. 40

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Foreslow no time, sweet Lancaster; let’s march.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    How comes it that the king and he is parted?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    That thus your army, going several ways,
    Might be of lesser force; and with the power 44
    That he intendeth presently to raise,
    Be easily suppress’d; therefore be gone.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Here in the river rides a Flemish hoy;
    Let’s all aboard, and follow him amain. 48

LANCASTER

    The wind that bears him hence will fill our sails:
    Come, come aboard, ’tis but an hour’s sailing.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Madam, stay you within this castle here.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    No, Mortimer, I’ll to my lord the king. 52

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Nay, rather sail with us to Scarborough.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    You know the king is so suspicious,
    As if he hear I have but talk’d with you,
    Mine honour will be call’d in question; 56
    And therefore, gentle Mortimer, be gone.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Madam, I cannot stay to answer you,
    But think of Mortimer as he deserves.

[Exeunt all except QUEEN ISABELLA.]

QUEEN ISABELLA

    So well hast thou deserv’d sweet Mortimer, 60
    As Isabel could live with thee for ever!
    In vain I look for love at Edward’s hand,
    Whose eyes are fix’d on none but Gaveston;
    Yet once more I’ll importune him with prayers. 64
    If he be strange and not regard my words,
    My son and I will over into France,
    And to the king my brother there complain,
    How Gaveston hath robb’d me of his love: 68
    But yet I hope my sorrows will have end,
    And Gaveston this blessed day be slain. 

GAVESTON

    Yet, lusty lords, I have escap’d your hands,
    Your threats, your ’larums, and your hot pursuits;
    And though divorced from King Edward’s eyes,
    Yet liveth Pierce of Gaveston unsurpris’d, 4
    Breathing, in hope (malgrado 2 all your beards,
    That muster rebels thus against your king),
    To see his royal sovereign once again.

[Enter (WARWICK, LANCASTER, PEMBROKE, Young MORTIMER, Soldiers, JAMES, and other Attendants of PEMBROKE)]

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Upon him, soldiers, take away his weapons. 8

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Thou proud disturber of thy country’s peace,
    Corrupter of thy king, cause of these broils,
    Base flatterer, yield! and were it not for shame,
    Shame and dishonour to a soldier’s name, 12
    Upon my weapon’s point here should’st thou fall,
    And welter in thy gore.

LANCASTER

    Monster of men!
    That, like the Greekish strumpet, train’d to arms 16
    And bloody wars so many valiant knights;
    Look for no other fortune, wretch, than death!
    King Edward is not here to buckler thee.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Lancaster, why talk’st thou to the slave? 20
    Go, soldiers, take him hence, for, by my sword,
    His head shall off. Gaveston, short warning
    Shall serve thy turn; it is our country’s cause
    That here severely we will execute 24
    Upon thy person. Hang him at a bough.

GAVESTON

    My lord!—

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Soldiers, have him away;—
    But for thou wert the favourite of a king, 28
    Thou shalt have so much honour at our hands—

GAVESTON

    I thank you all, my lords: then I perceive,
    That heading is one, and hanging is the other,
    And death is all. 32

[Enter EARL OF ARUNDEL]

LANCASTER

    How now, my lord of Arundel?

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    My lords, King Edward greets you all by me.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Arundel, say your message.

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    His majesty, 36
    Hearing that you had taken Gaveston,
    Entreateth you by me, yet but he may
    See him before he dies; for why, he says,
    And sends you word, he knows that die he shall; 40
    And if you gratify his grace so far,
    He will be mindful of the courtesy.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    How now?

GAVESTON

    Renownèd Edward, how thy name 44
    Revives poor Gaveston!

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    No, it needeth not;
    Arundel, we will gratify the king
    In other matters; he must pardon us in this. 48
    Soldiers, away with him!

GAVESTON

    Why, my lord of Warwick,
    Will not these delays beget my hopes?
    I know it, lords, it is this life you aim at, 52
    Yet grant King Edward this.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Shalt thou appoint
    What we shall grant? Soldiers, away with him!
    Thus we’ll gratify the king: 56
    We’ll send his head by thee; let him bestow
    His tears on that, for that is all he gets
    Of Gaveston, or else his senseless trunk.

LANCASTER

    Not so, my lords, lest he bestow more cost 60
    In burying him than he hath ever earn’d.

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    My lords, it is his majesty’s request,
    And in the honour of a king he swears,
    He will but talk with him, and send him back. 64

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    When? Can you tell? Arundel, no; we wot
    He that the care of his realm remits,
    And drives his nobles to these exigents 5
    For Gaveston, will, if he sees 6 him once, 68
    Violate any promises to possess him.

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    Then if you will not trust his grace in keep,
    My lords, I will be pledge for his return.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    ’Tis honourable in thee to offer this; 72
    But for we know thou art a noble gentleman,
    We will not wrong thee so, to make away
    A true man for a thief.

GAVESTON

    How mean’st thou, Mortimer? That is over-base. 76

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Away, base groom, robber of king’s renown!
    Question with thy companions and thy mates.

PEMBROKE

    My Lord Mortimer, and you, my lords, each one,
    To gratify the king’s request therein, 80
    Touching the sending of this Gaveston,
    Because his majesty so earnestly
    Desires to see the man before his death,
    I will upon mine honour undertake 84
    To carry him, and bring him back again;
    Provided this, that you my lord of Arundel
    Will join with me.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Pembroke, what wilt thou do? 88
    Cause yet more bloodshed? Is it not enough
    That we have taken him, but must we now
    Leave him on “had I wist,” and let him go?

PEMBROKE

    My lords, I will not over-woo your honours, 92
    But if you dare trust Pembroke with the prisoner,
    Upon mine oath, I will return him back.

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    My lord of Lancaster, what say you in this?

LANCASTER

    Why, say, let him go on Pembroke’s word. 96

PEMBROKE

    And you, Lord Mortimer?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    How say you, my lord of Warwick?

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Nay, do your pleasures, I know how ’twill prove.

PEMBROKE

    Then give him me. 100

GAVESTON

    Sweet sovereign, yet I come
    To see thee ere I die.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Yet not perhaps,
    If Warwick’s wit and policy prevail. [Aside.] 104

YOUNG MORTIMER

    My lord of Pembroke, we deliver him you;
    Return him on your honour. Sound, away!

[Exeunt all except PEMBROKE, ARUNDEL, GAVESTON, (JAMES,) and other Attendants of PEMBROKE. ] PEMBROKE

    (My lord of Arundel,) you shall go with me.
    My house is not far hence; out of the way 108
    A little, but our men shall go along.
    We that have pretty wenches to our wives,
    Sir, must not come so near and baulk their lips.

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    ’Tis very kindly spoke, my lord of Pembroke; 112
    Your honour hath an adamant of power
    To draw a prince.

PEMBROKE

    So, my lord. Come hither, James:
    I do commit this Gaveston to thee, 116
    Be thou this night his keeper; in the morning
    We will discharge thee of thy charge. Be gone.

GAVESTON

    Unhappy Gaveston, whither goest thou now? 

GAVESTON

    O treacherous Warwick! thus to wrong thy friend.

JAMES

    I see it is your life these arms pursue.

GAVESTON

    Weaponless must I fall, and die in bands?
    O! must this day be period of my life? 4
    Centre of all my bliss! An ye be men,
    Speed to the king.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    My lord of Pembroke’s men,
    Strive you no longer—I will have that Gaveston. 8 

JAMES

    Your lordship does dishonour to yourself,
    And wrong our lord, your honourable friend.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    No, James, it is my country’s cause I follow.
    Go, take the villain; soldiers, come away. 12
    We’ll make quick work. Commend me to your master,
    My friend, and tell him that I watch’d it well.
    Come, let thy shadow 1 parley with King Edward.

GAVESTON

    Treacherous earl, shall I not see the king? 16

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    The king of Heaven, perhaps; no other king.
    Away!

[Exeunt WARWICK and Soldiers with GAVESTON.] JAMES

    Come, fellows, it booted not for us to strive,
    We will in haste go certify our lord.

KING EDWARD

    I long to hear an answer from the barons
    Touching my friend, my dearest Gaveston.
    Ah! Spencer, not the riches of my realm
    Can ransom him! Ah, he is mark’d to die! 4
    I know the malice of the younger Mortimer,
    Warwick I know is rough, and Lancaster
    Inexorable, and I shall never see
    My lovely Pierce, my Gaveston again! 8
    The barons overbear me with their pride.

YOUNG SPENCER

    Were I King Edward, England’s sovereign,
    Son to the lovely Eleanor of Spain,
    Great Edward Longshanks’ issue, would I bear 12
    These braves, this rage, and suffer uncontroll’d
    These barons thus to beard me in my land,
    In mine own realm? My lord, pardon my speech:
    Did you retain your father’s magnanimity, 16
    Did you regard the honour of your name,
    You would not suffer thus your majesty
    Be counterbuff’d of your nobility.
    Strike off their heads, and let them preach on poles! 20
    No doubt, such lessons they will teach the rest,
    As by their preachments they will profit much,
    And learn obedience to their lawful king.

KING EDWARD

    Yea, gentle Spencer, we have been too mild, 24
    Too kind to them; but now have drawn our sword,
    And if they send me not my Gaveston,
    We’ll steel it on their crest, and poll their tops.

BALDOCK

    This haught resolve becomes your majesty, 28
    Not to be tied to their affection,
    As though your highness were a schoolboy still,
    And must be aw’d and govern’d like a child.

[Enter the Elder SPENCER, with his truncheon and Soldiers]

ELDER SPENCER

    Long live my sovereign, the noble Edward, 32
    In peace triumphant, fortunate in wars!

KING EDWARD

    Welcome, old man, com’st thou in Edward’s aid?
    Then tell thy prince of whence, and what thou art.

ELDER SPENCER

    Lo, with a band of bowmen and of pikes, 36
    Brown bills and targeteers, four hundred strong,
    Sworn to defend King Edward’s royal right,
    I come in person to your majesty,
    Spencer, the father of Hugh Spencer there, 40
    Bound to your highness everlastingly,
    For favour done, in him, unto us all.

KING EDWARD

    Thy father, Spencer?

YOUNG SPENCER

    True, an it like your grace, 44
    That pours, in lieu of all your goodness shown,
    His life, my lord, before your princely feet.

KING EDWARD

    Welcome ten thousand times, old man, again.
    Spencer, this love, this kindness to thy king, 48
    Argues thy noble mind and disposition.
    Spencer, I here create thee Earl of Wiltshire,
    And daily will enrich thee with our favour,
    That, as the sunshine, shall reflect o’er thee. 52
    Beside, the more to manifest our love,
    Because we hear Lord Bruce doth sell his land,
    And that the Mortimers are in hand withal,
    Thou shalt have crowns of us t’ outbid the barons: 56
    And, Spencer, spare them not, but lay it on.
    Soldiers, a largess, and thrice welcome all!

YOUNG SPENCER

    My lord, here comes the queen.

[Enter QUEEN ISABELLA, and her son PRINCE EDWARD, and LEVUNE, a Frenchman]

KING EDWARD

    Madam, what news? 60

QUEEN ISABELLA

    News of dishonour, lord, and discontent.
    Our friend Levune, faithful and full of trust,
    Informeth us, by letters and by words,
    That Lord Valois our brother, King of France, 64
    Because your highness hath been slack in homage,
    Hath seized Normandy into his hands.
    These be the letters, this the messenger.

KING EDWARD

    Welcome, Levune. Tush, Sib, if this be all 68
    Valois and I will soon be friends again.—
    But to my Gaveston; shall I never see,
    Never behold thee now?—Madam, in this matter,
    We will employ you and your little son; 72
    You shall go parley with the King of France.—
    Boy, see you bear you bravely to the king,
    And do your message with a majesty.

PRINCE EDWARD

    Commit not to my youth things of more weight 76
    Than fits a prince so young as I to bear,
    And fear not, lord and father, Heaven’s great beams
    On Atlas’ shoulder shall not lie more safe,
    Than shall your charge committed to my trust. 80

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Ah, boy! this towardness makes thy mother fear
    Thou art not mark’d to many days on earth.

KING EDWARD

    Madam, we will that you with speed be shipp’d,
    And this our son; Levune shall follow you 84
    With all the haste we can despatch him hence.
    Choose of our lords to bear you company,
    And go in peace; leave us in wars at home.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Unnatural wars, where subjects brave their king; 88
    God end them once! My lords, I take my leave,
    To make my preparation for France.

[Exit with PRINCE EDWARD.]

[Enter ARUNDEL.]

KING EDWARD

    What, Lord Arundel, dost thou come alone?

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    Yea, my good lord, for Gaveston is dead. 92

KING EDWARD

    Ah, traitors! have they put my friend to death?
    Tell me, Arundel, died he ere thou cam’st,
    Or didst thou see my friend to take his death?

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    Neither, my lord; for as he was surpris’d, 96
    Begirt with weapons and with enemies round,
    I did your highness’ message to them all;
    Demanding him of them, entreating rather,
    And said, upon the honour of my name, 100
    That I would undertake to carry him
    Unto your highness, and to bring him back.

KING EDWARD

    And tell me, would the rebels deny me that?

YOUNG SPENCER

    Proud recreants! 104

KING EDWARD

    Yea, Spencer, traitors all.

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    I found them at the first inexorable;
    The Earl of Warwick would not bide the hearing,
    Mortimer hardly; Pembroke and Lancaster 108
    Spake least: and when they flatly had denied,
    Refusing to receive me pledge for him,
    The Earl of Pembroke mildly thus bespake;
    “My lords, because our sovereign sends for him, 112
    And promiseth he shall be safe return’d,
    I will this undertake, to have him hence,
    And see him re-delivered to your hands.”

KING EDWARD

    Well, and how fortunes [it] that he came not? 116

YOUNG SPENCER

    Some treason, or some villainy, was the cause.

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    The Earl of Warwick seiz’d him on his way;
    For being delivered unto Pembroke’s men,
    Their lord rode home thinking his prisoner safe; 120
    But ere he came, Warwick in ambush lay,
    And bare him to his death; and in a trench
    Strake off his head, and march’d unto the camp.

YOUNG SPENCER

    A bloody part, flatly ’gainst law of arms! 124

KING EDWARD

    O shall I speak, or shall I sigh and die!

YOUNG SPENCER

    My lord, refer your vengeance to the sword
    Upon these barons; hearten up your men;
    Let them not unreveng’d murder your friends! 128
    Advance your standard, Edward, in the field,
    And march to fire them from their starting holes.

KING EDWARD(Kneeling.)

    By earth, the common mother of us all,
    By Heaven, and all the moving orbs thereof, 132
    By this right hand, and by my father’s sword,
    And all the honours ’longing to my crown,
    I will have heads, and lives for him, as many
    As I have manors, castles, towns, and towers!— [Rises.] 136
    Treacherous Warwick! traitorous Mortimer!
    If it be England’s king, in lakes of gore
    Your headless trunks, your bodies will I trail,
    That you may drink your fill, and quaff in blood, 140
    And stain my royal standard with the same,
    That so my bloody colours may suggest
    Remembrance of revenge immortally
    On your accursed traitorous progeny, 144
    You villains, that have slain my Gaveston!
    And in this place of honour and of trust,
    Spencer, sweet Spencer, I adopt thee here:
    And merely of our love we do create thee 148
    Earl of Gloucester, and Lord Chamberlain,
    Despite of times, despite of enemies.

YOUNG SPENCER

    My lord, here’s a messenger from the barons.
    Desires access unto your majesty. 152

KING EDWARD

    Admit him near.

[Enter the Herald, with his coat of arms]

HERALD

    Long live King Edward, England’s lawful lord!

KING EDWARD

    So wish not they, I wis, that sent thee hither.
    Thou com’st from Mortimer and his ’complices, 156
    A ranker rout of rebels never was.
    Well, say thy message.

HERALD

    The barons up in arms, by me salute
    Your highness with long life and happiness; 160
    And bid me say, as plainer to your grace,
    That if without effusion of blood
    You will this grief have ease and remedy,
    That from your princely person you remove 164
    This Spencer, as a putrifying brance,
    That deads the royal vine, whose golden leaves
    Empale your princely head, your diadem,
    Whose brightness such pernicious upstarts dim, 168
    Say they; and lovingly advise your grace,
    To cherish virtue and nobility,
    And have old servitors in high esteem,
    And shake off smooth dissembling flatterers. 172
    This granted, they, their honours, and their lives,
    Are to your highness vow’d and consecrate.

YOUNG SPENCER

    Ah, traitors! will they still display their pride?

KING EDWARD

    Away, tarry no answer, but be gone! 176
    Rebels, will they appoint their sovereign
    His sports, his pleasures, and his company?
    Yet, ere thou go, see how I do divorce

[Embraces SPENCER.]

    Spencer from me.—Now get thee to thy lords, 180
    And tell them I will come to chastise them
    For murdering Gaveston; hie thee, get thee gone!
    Edward with fire and sword follows at thy heels. [Exit Herald.]
    My lords, perceive you how these rebels swell? 184
    Soldiers, good hearts, defend your sovereign’s right,
    For now, even now, we march to make them stoop.
    Away! 

KING EDWARD

    Why do we sound retreat? Upon them, lords!
    This day I shall pour vengeance with my sword
    On those proud rebels that are up in arms
    And do confront and countermand their king. 4

YOUNG SPENCER

    I doubt it not, my lord, right will prevail.

ELDER SPENCER

    ’Tis not amiss, my liege, for either part
    To breathe awhile; our men, with sweat and dust
    All choked well near, begin to faint for heat; 8
    And this retire refresheth horse and man.

YOUNG SPENCER

    Here come the rebels.

[Enter Young MORTIMER, LANCASTER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, and others.]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Look, Lancaster, yonder is Edward
    Among his flatterers. 12

LANCASTER

    And there let him be
    Till he pay dearly for their company.

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    And shall, or Warwick’s sword shall smite in vain.

KING EDWARD

    What, rebels, do you shrink and sound retreat? 16

YOUNG MORTIMER

    No, Edward, no; thy flatterers faint and fly.

LANCASTER

    They’d best betimes forsake thee, and their trains,
    For they’ll betray thee, traitors as they are.

YOUNG SPENCER

    Traitor on thy face, rebellious Lancaster! 20

PEMBROKE

    Away, base upstart, bravest thou nobles thus?

ELDER SPENCER

    A noble attempt and honourable deed,
    Is it not, trow ye, to assemble aid,
    And levy arms against your lawful king! 24

KING EDWARD

    For which ere long their heads shall satisfy,
    To appease the wrath of their offended king.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Then, Edward, thou wilt fight it to the last,
    And rather bathe thy sword in subjects’ blood, 28
    Than banish that pernicious company?

KING EDWARD

    Ay, traitors all, rather than thus be brav’d,
    Make England’s civil towns huge heaps of stones,
    And ploughs to go about our palace-gates. 32

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    A desperate and unnatural resolution!
    Alarum! To the fight!
    St. George for England, and the barons’ right!

KING EDWARD

    Saint George for England, and King Edward’s right!

KING EDWARD

    Now, lusty lords, now, not by chance of war,
    But justice of the quarrel and the cause,
    Vail’d 1 is your pride; methinks you hang the heads,
    But we’ll advance them, traitors. Now ’tis time 4
    To be avenged on you for all your braves,
    And for the murder of my dearest friend,
    To whom right well you knew our soul was knit,
    Good Pierce of Gaveston, my sweet favourite. 8
    Ah, rebels! recreants! you made him away.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Brother, in regard of thee, and of thy land,
    Did they remove that flatterer from thy throne.

KING EDWARD

    So, sir, you have spoke; away, avoid our presence. 12

[Exit KENT.]

    Accursed wretches, was’t in regard of us,
    When we had sent our messenger to request
    He might be spar’d to come to speak with us,
    And Pembroke undertook for his return, 16
    That thou, proud Warwick, watch’d the prisoner,
    Poor Pierce, and headed him ’gainst law of arms?
    For which thy head shall overlook the rest,
    As much as thou in rage outwent’st the rest. 20

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Tyrant, I scorn thy threats and menaces;
    It is but temporal that thou canst inflict.

LANCASTER

    The worst is death, and better die to live
    Than live in infamy under such a king. 24

KING EDWARD

    Away with them, my lord of Winchester!
    These lusty leaders, Warwick and Lancaster,
    I charge you roundly—off with both their heads!
    Away! 28

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

    Farewell, vain world!

LANCASTER

    Sweet Mortimer, farewell.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    England, unkind to thy nobility,
    Groan for this grief, behold how thou art maim’d! 32

KING EDWARD

    Go take that haughty Mortimer to the Tower,
    There see him safe bestow’d; and for the rest,
    Do speedy execution on them all.
    Begone! 36

YOUNG MORTIMER

    What, Mortimer! can ragged stony walls
    Immure thy virtue that aspires to Heaven?
    No, Edward, England’s scourage, it may not be;
    Mortimer’s hope surmounts his fortune far. [The captive Barons are led off.] 40

KING EDWARD

    Sound drums and trumpets! March with me, my friends,
    Edward this day hath crown’d him king anew.

[Exeunt all except Young SPENCER, LEVUNE, and BALDOCK.]

YOUNG SPENCER

    Levune, the trust that we repose in thee,
    Begets the quiet of King Edward’s land. 44
    Therefore begone in haste, and with advice
    Bestow that treasure on the lords of France,
    That, therewith all enchanted, like the guard
    That suffered Jove to pass in showers of gold 48
    To Danae, all aid may be denied
    To Isabel, the queen, that now in France
    Makes friends, to cross the seas with her young son,
    And step into his father’s regiment. 2 52

LEVUNE

    That’s it these barons and the subtle queen
    Long levell’d at.

BALDOCK

    Yea, but, Levune, thou seest
    These barons lay their heads on blocks together; 56
    What they intend, the hangman frustrates clean.

LEVUNE

    Have you no doubt, my lords, I’ll clap so close
    Among the lords of France with England’s gold,
    That Isabel shall make her plaints in vain, 60
    And France shall be obdurate with her tears.

YOUNG SPENCER

    Then make for France, amain—Levune, away!
    Proclaim King Edward’s wars and victories. 

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Fair blows the wind for France; blow gentle gale,
    Till Edmund be arriv’d for England’s good!
    Nature, yield to my country’s cause in this.
    A brother? No, a butcher of thy friends! 4
    Proud Edward, dost thou banish me thy presence?
    But I’ll to France, and cheer the wronged queen,
    And certify what Edward’s looseness is.
    Unnatural king! to slaughter noblemen 8
    And cherish flatterers! Mortimer, I stay
    Thy sweet escape: stand gracious, gloomy night,
    To his device. 

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Holla! who walketh there? 12
    Is’t you, my lord?

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Mortimer, ’tis I;
    But hath thy potion wrought so happily?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    It hath, my Lord; the warders all asleep, 16
    I thank them, gave me leave to pass in peace.
    But hath your grace got shipping unto France?

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Fear it not. 

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Ah, boy! our friends do fail us all in France.
    The lords are cruel, and the king unkind;
    What shall we do?

PRINCE EDWARD

    Madam, return to England, 4
    And please my father well, and then a fig
    For all my uncle’s friendship here in France.
    I warrant you, I’ll win his highness quickly;
    ’A loves me better than a thousand Spencers. 8

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Ah, boy, thou art deceiv’d, at least in this,
    To think that we can yet be tun’d together;
    No, no, we jar too far. Unkind Valois!
    Unhappy Isabel! when France rejects, 12
    Whither, oh! whither dost thou bend thy steps?

[Enter SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT]

SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT

    Madam, what cheer?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Ah! good Sir John of Hainault,
    Never so cheerless, nor so far distrest. 16

SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT

    I hear, sweet lady, of the king’s unkindness;
    But droop not, madam; noble minds contemn
    Despair. Will your grace with me to Hainault,
    And there stay time’s advantage with your son? 20
    How say you, my lord, will you go with your friends,
    And shake off all our fortunes equally?

PRINCE EDWARD

    So pleaseth the queen, my mother, me it likes.
    The King of England, nor the court of France, 24
    Shall have me from my gracious mother’s side,
    Till I be strong enough to break a staff;
    And then have at the proudest Spencer’s head.

SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT

    Well said, my lord. 28

QUEEN ISABELLA

    O, my sweet heart, how do I moan thy wrongs,
    Yet triumph in the hope of thee, my joy!
    Ah, sweet Sir John! even to the utmost verge
    Of Europe, or the shore of Tanais, 32
    Will we with thee to Hainault—so we will:—
    The marquis is a noble gentleman;
    His grace, I dare presume, will welcome me.
    But who are these? 36

[Enter KENT and Young MORTIMER]

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Madam, long may you live,
    Much happier than your friends in England do!

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Lord Edmund and Lord Mortimer alive!
    Welcome to France! The news was here, my lord, 40
    That you were dead, or very near your death.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Lady, the last was truest of the twain;
    But Mortimer, reserv’d for better hap,
    Hath shaken off the thraldom of the Tower, 44
    And lives t’ advance your standard, good my lord.

PRINCE EDWARD

    How mean you? An 1 the king, my father, lives?
    No, my Lord Mortimer, not I, I trow.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Not, son! why not? I would it were no worse. 48
    But, gentle lords, friendless we are in France.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Monsieur le Grand, a noble friend of yours,
    Told us, at our arrival, all the news:
    How hard the nobles, how unkind the king 52
    Hath show’d himself; but, madam, right makes room
    Where weapons want; and, though a many friends
    Are made away, as Warwick, Lancaster,
    And others of our party and faction; 56
    Yet have we friends, assure your grace, in England
    Would cast up caps, and clap their hands for joy,
    To see us there, appointed for our foes.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Would all were well, and Edward well reclaim’d, 60
    For England’s honour, peace, and quietness.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    But by the sword, my lord, ’t must be deserv’d; 3
    The king will ne’er forsake his flatterers.

SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT

    My lord of England, sith th’ ungentle king 64
    Of France refuseth to give aid of arms
    To this distressed queen his sister here,
    Go you with her to Hainault. Doubt ye not,
    We will find comfort, money, men, and friends 68
    Ere long, to bid the English king a base. 4
    How say, young prince? What think you of the match?

PRINCE EDWARD

    I think King Edward will outrun us all.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Nay, son, not so; and you must not discourage 72
    Your friends, that are so forward in your aid.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Sir John of Hainault, pardon us, I pray;
    These comforts that you give our woful queen
    Bind us in kindness all at your command. 76

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Yea, gentle brother; and the God of heaven
    Prosper your happy motion, good Sir John.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    This noble gentleman, forward in arms,
    Was born, I see, to be our anchor-hold. 80
    Sir John of Hainault, be it thy renown,
    That England’s queen and nobles in distress,
    Have been by thee restor’d and comforted.

SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT

    Madam, along, and you my lords, with me, 84
    That England’s peers may Hainault’s welcome see. 

KING EDWARD

    Thus after many threats of wrathful war,
    Triumpheth England’s Edward with his friends;
    And triumph, Edward, with his friends uncontroll’d!
    My lord of Gloucester, do you hear the news? 4

YOUNG SPENCER

    What news, my lord?

KING EDWARD

    Why, man, they say there is great execution
    Done through the realm; my lord of Arundel,
    You have the note, have you not? 8

EARL OF ARUNDEL

    From the Lieutenant of the Tower, my lord.

KING EDWARD

    I pray let us see it.

[Takes the note.]

    What have we there?
    Read it, Spencer.

[Hands the note to Young SPENCER, who reads the names.]

    Why, so; they bark’d apace a month ago: 12
    Now, on my life, they’ll neither bark nor bite.
    Now, sirs, the news from France? Gloucester, I trow
    The lords of France love England’s gold so well
    As Isabella gets no aid from thence. 16
    What now remains? Have you proclaim’d, my lord,
    Reward for them can bring in Mortimer?

YOUNG SPENCER

    My lord, we have; and if he be in England,
    ’A will be had ere long, I doubt it not. 20

KING EDWARD

    If, dost thou say? Spencer, as true as death,
    He is in England’s ground; our portmasters
    Are not so careless of their king’s command.

[Enter a Messenger]

    How now, what news with thee? From whence come these? 24

MESSENGER

    Letters, my lord, and tidings forth of France;—
    To you, my lord of Gloucester, from Levune.

[Gives letters to Young SPENCER.]

KING EDWARD

    Read.

YOUNG SPENCER(reads).

    “My duty to your honour premised, &c., I have, according to instructions :in that behalf, dealt with the King of France his lords, and effected that the queen, all discontented and discomforted, is gone: whither, if your ask, with Sir John of Hainault, brother to the marquis, into Flanders. With them are gone Lord Edmund, and the Lord Mortimer, having in their company divers of your nation, and others; and, as constant report goeth, they intend to give King Edward battle in England, sooner than he can look for them. This is all the news of import.

Your honour’s in all service, LEVUNE.” 28

KING EDWARD

    Ah, villains! hath that Mortimer escap’d
    With him is Edmund gone associate?
    And will Sir John of Hainault lead the round?
    Welcome, a God’s name, madam, and your son; 32
    England shall welcome you and all your rout.
    Gallop apace, bright Phœbus, through the sky,
    And dusky night, in rusty iron car,
    Between you both shorten the time, I pray, 36
    That I may see that most desired day
    When we may meet these traitors in the field.
    Ah, nothing grieves me, but my little boy
    Is thus misled to countenance their ills. 40
    Come, friends, to Bristow, 1 there to make us strong;
    And, winds, as equal be to bring them in,
    As you injurious were to bear them forth! 

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Now, lords, our loving friends and countrymen,
    Welcome to England all, with prosperous winds!
    Our kindest friends in Belgia have we left,
    To cope with friends at home; a heavy case 4
    When force to force is knit, and sword and glaive
    In civil broils make kin and countrymen
    Slaughter themselves in others, and their sides
    With their own weapons gore! But what’s the help? 8
    Misgoverned kings are cause of all this wrack;
    And, Edward, thou art one among them all,
    Whose looseness hath betray’d thy land to spoil,
    Who made the channels overflow with blood. 12
    Of thine own people patron shouldst thou be,
    But thou——

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Nay, madam, if you be a warrior,
    You must not grow so passionate in speeches. 16
    Lords,
    Sith that we are by sufferance of Heaven
    Arriv’d, and armed in this prince’s right,
    Here for our country’s cause swear we to him 20
    All homage, fealty, and forwardness;
    And for the open wrongs and injuries
    Edward hath done to us; his queen and land,
    We come in arms to wreak it with the sword; 24
    That England’s queen in peace may repossess
    Her dignities and honours; and withal
    We may remove these flatterers from the king,
    That havoc England’s wealth and treasury. 28

SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT

    Sound trumpets, my lord, and forward let us march.
    Edward will think we come to flatter him.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    I would he never had been flattered more! 

YOUNG SPENCER

    Fly, fly, my lord! the queen is over-strong;
    Her friends do multiply, and yours do fail.
    Shape we our course to Ireland, there to breathe.

KING EDWARD

    What! was I born to fly and run away, 4
    And leave the Mortimers conquerors behind?
    Give me my horse, and let’s reinforce our troops:
    And in this bed of honour die with fame.

BALDOCK

    O no, my lord, this princely resolution 8
    Fits not the time; away! we are pursued.

[Exeunt.]

[Enter KENT, with sword and target]

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    This way he fled, but I am come too late
    Edward, alas! my heart relents for thee.
    Proud traitor, Mortimer, why dost thou chase 12
    Thy lawful king, thy sovereign, with thy sword?
    Vile wretch! and why hast thou, of all unkind,
    Borne arms against thy brother and thy king?
    Rain showers of vengeance on my cursed head, 16
    Thou God, to whom in justice it belongs
    To punish this unnatural revolt!
    Edward, this Mortimer aims at thy life!
    O fly him, then! But, Edmund, calm this rage, 20
    Dissemble, or thou diest; for Mortimer
    And Isabel do kiss, while they conspire;
    And yet she bears a face of love forsooth.
    Fie on that love that hatcheth death and hate! 24
    Edmund, away! Bristow to Longshanks’ blood
    Is false. Be not found single for suspect:
    Proud Mortimer pries near unto thy walks.

[Enter QUEEN ISABELLA, PRINCE EDWARD, Young MORTIMER, and SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT]

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Successful battle gives the God of kings 28
    To them that fight in right and fear his wrath.
    Since then successfully we have prevailed,
    Thanked be Heaven’s great architect, and you.
    Ere farther we proceed, my noble lords, 32
    We here create our well-beloved son,
    Of love and care unto his royal person,
    Lord Warden of the realm, and sith the fates
    Have made his father so infortunate, 36
    Deal you, my lords, in this, my loving lords,
    As to your wisdoms fittest seems in all.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Madam, without offence, if I may ask,
    How will you deal with Edward in his fall? 40

PRINCE EDWARD

    Tell me, good uncle, what Edward do you mean?

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Nephew, your father; I dare not call him king.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    My lord of Kent, what needs these questions?
    ’Tis not in her controlment, nor in ours, 44
    But as the realm and parliament shall please,
    So shall your brother be disposed of.—
    I like not this relenting mood in Edmund.
    Madam, ’tis good to look to him betimes. [Aside to the QUEEN.] 48

QUEEN ISABELLA

    My lord, the Mayor of Bristow knows our mind.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Yea, madam, and they scape not easily
    That fled the field.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Baldock is with the king. 52
    A goodly chancellor, is he not, my lord?

SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT

    So are Spencers, the father and the son.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    This Edward is the ruin of the realm.

[Enter RICE AP HOWELL and the Mayor of Bristow, with the Elder SPENCER (Prisoner, and Attendants)]

RICE AP HOWELL

    God save Queen Isabel, and her princely son! 56
    Madam, the mayor and citizens of Bristow,
    In sign of love and duty to this presence,
    Present by me this traitor to the state,
    Spencer, the father to that wanton Spencer, 60
    That, like the lawless Catiline of Rome,
    Revelled in England’s wealth and treasury.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    We thank you all.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Your loving care in this 64
    Deserveth princely favours and rewards.
    But where’s the king and the other Spencer fled?

RICE AP HOWELL

    Spencer the son, created Earl of Gloucester,
    Is with that smooth-tongu’d scholar Baldock gone 68
    And shipped but late for Ireland with the king.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Some whirlwind fetch them back or sink them all!— [Aside.]
    They shall be started thence, I doubt it not.

PRINCE EDWARD

    Shall I not see the king my father yet? 72

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Unhappy’s Edward, chas’d from England’s bounds. [Aside.]

SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT

    Madam, what resteth, why stand you in a muse?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    I rue my lord’s ill-fortune; but alas!
    Care of my country call’d me to this war. 76

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Madam, have done with care and sad complaint;
    Your king hath wrong’d your country and himself,
    And we must seek to right it as we may.
    Meanwhile, have hence this rebel to the block. 80
    Your lordship cannot privilege your head.

ELDER SPENCER

    Rebel is he that fights against his prince;
    So fought not they that fought in Edward’s right.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Take him away, he prates; 84

[Exeunt Attendants with the Elder SPENCER.)

        You, Rice ap Howell,

    Shall do good service to her majesty,
    Being of countenance in your country here,
    To follow these rebellious runagates. 88
    We in meanwhile, madam, must take advice,
    How Baldock, Spencer, and their complices,
    May in their fall be followed to their end. 

ABBOT

    Have you no doubt, my lord; have you no fear;
    As silent and as careful we will be,
    To keep your royal person safe with us,
    Free from suspect and fell invasion 4
    Of such as have your majesty in chase,
    Yourself, and those your chosen company,
    As danger of this stormy time requires.

KING EDWARD

    Father, thy face should harbour no deceit. 8
    O! hadst thou ever been a king, thy heart,
    Pierced deeply with sense of my distress,
    Could not but take compassion of my state.
    Stately and proud, in riches and in train, 12
    Whilom I was, powerful, and full of pomp:
    But what is he whom rule and empery
    Have not in life or death made miserable?
    Come, Spencer; come, Baldock, come, sit down by me; 16
    Make trial now of that philosophy,
    That in our famous nurseries of arts
    Thou suck’dst from Plato and from Aristotle.
    Father, this life contemplative is Heaven. 20
    O that I might this life in quiet lead!
    But we, alas! are chas’d; and you, my friends,
    Your lives and my dishonour they pursue.
    Yet, gentle monks, for treasure, gold, nor fee, 24
    Do you betray us and our company.

MONK

    Your grace may sit secure, if none but we
    Do wot of your abode.

YOUNG SPENCER

    Not one alive; but shrewdly I suspect 28
    A gloomy fellow in a mead below.
    ’A gave a long look after us, my lord;
    And all the land I know is up in arms,
    Arms that pursue our lives with deadly hate. 32

BALDOCK

    We were embark’d for Ireland, wretched we!
    With awkward winds and [with] sore tempests driven
    To fall on shore, and here to pine in fear
    Of Mortimer and his confederates. 36

KING EDWARD

    Mortimer! who talks of Mortimer?
    Who wounds me with the name of Mortimer,
    That bloody man? Good father, on thy lap
    Lay I this head, laden with mickle care. 40
    O might I never open these eyes again!
    Never again lift up this drooping head!
    O never more lift up this dying heart!

YOUNG SPENCER

    Look up, my lord.—Baldock, this drowsiness 44
    Betides no good; here even we are betray’d.

[Enter, with Welsh hooks, RICE AP HOWELL, a Mower, and LEICESTER]

MOWER

    Upon my life, these be the men ye seek.

RICE AP HOWELL

    Fellow, enough.—My lord, I pray be short,
    A fair commission warrants what we do. 48

LEICESTER

    The queen’s commission, urged by Mortimer;
    What cannot gallant Mortimer with the queen?
    Alas! see where he sits, and hopes unseen
    To escape their hands that seek to reave his life. 52
    Too true it is, Quem dies vidit veniens superbum,
    Hunc dies vidit fugiens jacentem. 1
    But, Leicester, leave to grow so passionate.
    Spencer and Baldock, by no other names, 56
    I do arrest you of high treason here.
    Stand not on titles, but obey the arrest;
    ’Tis in the name of Isabel the queen.
    My lord, why droop you thus? 60

KING EDWARD

    O day, the last of all my bliss on earth!
    Centre of all misfortune! O my stars,
    Why do you lour unkindly on a king?
    Comes Leicester, then, in Isabella’s name 64
    To take my life, my company from me?
    Here, man, rip up this panting breast of mine,
    And take my heart in rescue of my friends!

RICE AP HOWELL

    Away with them! 68

YOUNG SPENCER

    It may become thee yet
    To let us take our farewell of his grace.

ABBOT

    My heart with pity earns to see this sight,—
    A king to bear these words and proud commands. [Aside.] 72

KING EDWARD

    Spencer, ah, sweet Spencer, thus then must we part?

YOUNG SPENCER

    We must, my lord, so will the angry Heavens.

KING EDWARD

    Nay, so will hell and cruel Mortimer;
    The gentle Heavens have not to do in this. 76

BALDOCK

    My lord, it is in vain to grieve or storm.
    Here humbly of your grace we take our leaves;
    Our lots are cast; I fear me, so is thine.

KING EDWARD

    In Heaven we may, in earth ne’er shall we meet: 80
    And, Leicester, say, what shall become of us?

LEICESTER

    Your majesty must go to Killingworth. 3

KING EDWARD

    Must! it is somewhat hard, when kings must go.

LEICESTER

    Here is a litter ready for your grace, 84
    That waits your pleasure, and the day grows old.

RICE AP HOWELL

    As good be gone, as stay and be benighted.

KING EDWARD

    A litter hast thou? Lay me in a hearse,
    And to the gates of hell convey me hence; 88
    Let Pluto’s bells ring out my fatal knell,
    And hags howl for my death at Charon’s shore,
    For friends hath Edward none but these,
    And these must die under a tyrant’s sword. 92

RICE AP HOWELL

    My lord, be going; care not for these,
    For we shall see them shorter by the heads.

KING EDWARD

    Well, that shall be, shall be: part we must!
    Sweet Spencer, gentle Baldock, part we must! 96
    Hence feigned weeds! unfeigned are my woes; [Throws off his disguise.]
    Father, farewell! Leicester, thou stay’st for me,
    And go I must. Life, farewell, with my friends.

[Exeunt KING EDWARD and LEICESTER.]

YOUNG SPENCER

    O! is he gone? Is noble Edward gone? 100
    Parted from hence, never to see us more?
    Rend, sphere of Heaven! and, fire, forsake thy orb!
    Earth, melt to air! gone is my sovereign,
    Gone, gone, alas! never to make return. 104

BALDOCK

    Spencer, I see our souls are fleeted hence;
    We are depriv’d the sunshine of our life:
    Make for a new life, man; throw up thy eyes,
    And heart, and hands to Heaven’s immortal throne; 108
    Pay nature’s debt with cheerful countenance;
    Reduce we all our lessons unto this:
    To die, sweet Spencer, therefore live we all;
    Spencer, all live to die, and rise to fall. 112

RICE AP HOWELL

    Come, come, keep these preachments till you come to the place appointed. You, and such as you are, have made wise work in England. Will your lordships away?

Mow. Your lordship, I trust, will remember me? RICE AP HOWELL

    Remember thee, fellow! what else? Follow me to the town. 

LEICESTER

    Be patient, good my lord, cease to lament.
    Imagine Killingworth Castle were your court,
    And that you lay for pleasure here a space,
    Not of compulsion or necessity. 4

KING EDWARD

    Leicester, if gentle words might comfort me,
    Thy speeches long ago had eas’d my sorrows;
    For kind and loving hast thou always been.
    The griefs of private men are soon allay’d, 8
    But not of kings. The forest deer, being struck,
    Runs to an herb that closeth up the wounds;
    But, when the imperial lion’s flesh is gored,
    He rends and tears it with his wrathful paw, 12
    And highly scorning that the lowly earth
    Should drink his blood, mounts up into the air.
    And so it fares with me, whose dauntless mind
    The ambitious Mortimer would seek to curb, 16
    And that unnatural queen, false Isabel,
    That thus hath pent and mew’d me in a prison;
    For such outrageous passions cloy my soul,
    As with the wings of rancour and disdain, 20
    Full often am I soaring up to Heaven,
    To plain me to the gods against them both.
    But when I call to mind I am a king,
    Methinks I should revenge me of my wrongs, 24
    That Mortimer and Isabel have done.
    But what are kings, when regiment 1 is gone,
    But perfect shadows in a sunshine day?
    My nobles rule, I bear the name of king; 28
    I wear the crown, but am controll’d by them,
    By Mortimer, and my unconstant queen,
    Who spots my nuptial bed with infamy;
    Whilst I am lodg’d within this cave of care, 32
    Where sorrow at my elbow still attends,
    To company my heart with sad laments,
    That bleeds within me for this strange exchange.
    But tell me, must I now resign my crown, 36
    To make usurping Mortimer a king?

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER

    Your grace mistakes; it is for England’s good,
    And princely Edward’s right we crave the crown.

KING EDWARD

    No, ’tis for Mortimer, not Edward’s head; 40
    For he’s a lamb, encompassed by wolves,
    Which in a moment will abridge his life.
    But if proud Mortimer do wear this crown,
    Heavens turn it to a blaze of quenchless fire! 44
    Or like the snaky wreath of Tisiphon,
    Engirt the temples of his hateful head;
    So shall not England’s vine be perished,
    But Edward’s name survives, though Edward dies. 48

LEICESTER

    My lord, why waste you thus the time away?
    They stay your answer; will you yield your crown?

KING EDWARD

    Ah, Leicester, weigh how hardly I can brook
    To lose my crown and kingdom without cause; 52
    To give ambitious Mortimer my right,
    That like a mountain overwhelms my bliss,
    In which extreme my mind here murdered is.
    But what the heavens appoint, I must obey! 56
    Here, take my crown; the life of Edward too; [Taking off the crown.]
    Two kings in England cannot reign at once.
    But stay awhile, let me be king till night,
    That I may gaze upon this glittering crown; 60
    So shall my eyes receive their last content,
    My head, the latest honour due to it,
    And jointly both yield up their wished right.
    Continue ever thou celestial sun; 64
    Let never silent night possess this clime:
    Stand still you watches of the element;
    All times and seasons, rest you at a stay,
    That Edward may be still fair England’s king! 68
    But day’s bright beam doth vanish fast away,
    And needs I must resign my wished crown.
    Inhuman creatures! nurs’d with tiger’s milk!
    Why gape you for your sovereign’s overthrow! 72
    My diadem I mean, and guiltless life.
    See, monsters, see, I’ll wear my crown again! [He puts on the crown.]
    What, fear you not the fury of your king?
    But, hapless Edward, thou art fondly 2 led; 76
    They pass 3 not for thy frowns as late they did,
    But seek to make a new-elected king;
    Which fills my mind with strange despairing thoughts,
    Which thoughts are martyred with endless torments, 80
    And in this torment comfort find I none,
    But that I feel the crown upon my head;
    And therefore let me wear it yet awhile.

TRUSSEL

    My lord, the parliament must have present news, 84
    And therefore say, will you resign or no?

[The KING rageth.] KING EDWARD

    I’ll not resign, but whilst I live be king.
    Traitors, be gone and join with Mortimer!
    Elect, conspire, install, do what you will:— 88
    Their blood and yours shall seal these treacheries!

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER

    This answer we’ll return, and so farewell.

[Going with TRUSSEL.] LEICESTER

    Call them again, my lord, and speak them fair;
    For if they go, the prince shall lose his right. 92

KING EDWARD

    Call thou them back, I have no power to speak.

LEICESTER

    My lord, the king is willing to resign.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER

    If he be not, let him choose.

KING EDWARD

    O would I might, but heavens and earth conspire 96
    To make me miserable! Here receive my crown;
    Receive it? No, these innocent hands of mine
    Shall not be guilty of so foul a crime.
    He of you all that most desires my blood, 100
    And will be called the murderer of a king,
    Take it. What, are you moved? Pity you me?
    Then send for unrelenting Mortimer,
    And Isabel, whose eyes, being turned to steel, 104
    Will sooner sparkle fire than shed a tear.
    Yet stay, for rather than I’ll look on them,
    Here, here! [Gives the crown.]

        Now, sweet God of Heaven, 108

    Make me despise this transitory pomp,
    And sit for aye enthronized in Heaven!
    Come, death, and with thy fingers close my eyes,
    Or if I live, let me forget myself. 112

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER

    My lord—

KING EDWARD

    Call me not lord; away—out of my sight!
    Ah, pardon me: grief makes me lunatic!
    Let not that Mortimer protect my son; 116
    More safety is there in a tiger’s jaws,
    Than his embracements. Bear this to the queen,
    Wet with my tears, and dried again with sighs; [Gives a handkerchief.]
    If with the sight thereof she be not mov’d, 120
    Return it back and dip it in my blood.
    Commend me to my son, and bid him rule
    Better than I. Yet how have I transgress’d,
    Unless it be with too much clemency? 124

TRUSSEL

    And thus most humbly do we take our leave.

KING EDWARD

    Farewell;

[Exeunt the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER and TRUSSEL.]

    I know the next news that they bring
    Will be my death; and welcome shall it be; 128
    To wretched men, death is felicity.

[Enter BERKELEY, (who gives a paper to LEICESTER)]

LEICESTER

    Another post! what news brings he?

KING EDWARD

    Such news as I expect—come, Berkeley, come,
    And tell thy message to my naked breast. 132

BERKELEY

    My lord, think not a thought so villainous
    Can harbour in a man of noble birth.
    To do your highness service and devoir,
    And save you from your foes, Berkeley would die. 136

LEICESTER

    My lord, the council of the queen commands
    That I resign my charge.

KING EDWARD

    And who must keep me now? Must you, my lord?

BERKELEY

    Ay, my most gracious lord; so ’tis decreed. 140

KING EDWARD[taking the paper.]

    By Mortimer, whose name is written here!
    Well may I rend his name that rends my heart! [Tears it.]
    This poor revenge has something eas’d my mind.
    So may his limbs be torn, as is this paper! 144
    Hear me, immortal Jove, and grant it too!

BERKELEY

    Your grace must hence with me to Berkeley straight.

KING EDWARD

    Whither you will; all places are alike,
    And every earth is fit for burial. 148

LEICESTER

    Favour him, my lord, as much as lieth in you.

BERKELEY

    Even so betide my soul as I use him.

KING EDWARD

    Mine enemy hath pitied my estate,
    And that’s the cause that I am now remov’d. 152

BERKELEY

    And thinks your grace that Berkeley will be cruel?

KING EDWARD

    I know not; but of this am I assured,
    That death ends all, and I can die but once.
    Leicester, farewell! 156

LEICESTER

    Not yet, my lord; I’ll bear you on your way. 

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Fair Isabel, now have we our desire;
    The proud corrupters of the light-brain’d king
    Have done their homage to the lofty gallows,
    And he himself lies in captivity. 4
    Be rul’d by me, and we will rule the realm.
    In any case take heed of childish fear,
    For now we hold an old wolf by the ears,
    That, if he slip, will seize upon us both, 8
    And gripe the sorer, being grip’d himself.
    Think therefore, madam, that imports us much
    To erect your son with all the speed we may,
    And that I be protector over him; 12
    For our behoof will bear the greater sway
    Whenas a king’s name shall be under writ.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Sweet Mortimer, the life of Isabel,
    Be thou persuaded that I love thee well, 16
    And therefore, so the prince my son be safe,
    Whom I esteem as dear as these mine eyes,
    Conclude against his father what thou wilt,
    And I myself will willingly subscribe. 20

YOUNG MORTIMER

    First would I hear news that he were depos’d,
    And then let me alone to handle him.

[Enter MESSENGER]

    Letters! from whence?

MESSENGER

    From Killingworth, my lord. 24

QUEEN ISABELLA

    How fares my lord the king?

MESSENGER

    In health, madam, but full of pensiveness.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Alas, poor soul, would I could ease his grief!

[Enter the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER with the crown.]

    Thanks, gentle Winchester.

[To the Messenger.]

    Sirrah, be gone.

[Exit Messenger.] 28 BISHOP OF WINCHESTER

    The king hath willingly resign’d his crown.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    O happy news! send for the prince, my son.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER

    Further, or this letter was seal’d, Lord Berkeley came,
    So that he now is gone from Killingworth; 32
    And we have heard that Edmund laid a plot
    To set his brother free; no more but so.
    The lord of Berkeley is as pitiful
    As Leicester that had charge of him before. 36

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Then let some other be his guardian.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Let me alone, here is the privy seal.

[Exit the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER.]

    Who’s there?—Call hither Gurney and Matrevis.

[To Attendants within.]

    To dash the heavy-headed Edmund’s drift, 40
    Berkeley shall be discharg’d, the king remov’d,
    And none but we shall know where he lieth.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    But, Mortimer, as long as he survives,
    What safety rests for us, or for my son? 44

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Speak, shall he presently be despatch’d and die?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    I would he were, so ’twere not by my means.

[Enter MATREVIS and GURNEY]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Enough.—
    Matrevis, write a letter presently 48
    Unto the lord of Berkeley from ourself
    That he resign the king to thee and Gurney;
    And when ’tis done, we will subscribe our name.

MATREVIS

    It shall be done, my lord. [Writes.] 52

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Gurney.

GURNEY

    My lord.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    As thou intend’st to rise by Mortimer,
    Who now makes Fortune’s wheel turn as he please, 56
    Seek all the means thou canst to make him droop,
    And neither give him kind word nor good look.

GURNEY

    I warrant you, my lord.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    And this above the rest: because we hear 60
    That Edmund casts to work his liberty,
    Remove him still from thence place to place by night,
    Till at the last he come to Killingworth,
    And then from thence to Berkeley back again; 64
    And by the way, to make him fret the more,
    Speak curstly to him, and in any case
    Let no man comfort him; if he chance to weep,
    But amplify his grief with bitter words. 68

MATREVIS

    Fear not, my lord, we’ll do as you command.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    So now away; post thitherwards amain.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Whither goes this letter? To my lord the king?
    Commend me humbly to his majesty, 72
    And tell him that I labour all in vain
    To ease his grief, and work his liberty;
    And bear him this as witness of my love. [Gives a ring.]

MATREVIS

    I will, madam. [Exit with GURNEY.] 76

[Enter PRINCE EDWARD, and KENT talking with him]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Finely dissembled. Do so still, sweet queen.
    Here comes the young prince with the Earl of Kent.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Something he whispers in his childish ears.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    If he have such access unto the prince, 80
    Our plots and stratagems will soon be dash’d.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Use Edmund friendly, as if all were well.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    How fares my honourable lord of Kent?

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    In health, sweet Mortimer. How fares your grace? 84

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Well, if my lord your brother were enlarg’d.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    I hear of late he hath depos’d himself.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    The more my grief.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    And mine. 88

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Ah, they do dissemble! [Aside.]

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Sweet son, come hither, I must talk with thee.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    You being his uncle, and the next of blood,
    Do look to be protector o’er the prince. 92

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Not I, my lord; who should protect the son,
    But she that gave him life? I mean the queen.

PRINCE EDWARD

    Mother, persuade me not to wear the crown:
    Let him be king—I am too young to reign. 96

QUEEN ISABELLA

    But be content, seeing ’tis his highness’ pleasure.

PRINCE EDWARD

    Let me but see him first, and then I will.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Ay, do, sweet nephew.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Brother, you know it is impossible. 100

PRINCE EDWARD

    Why, is he dead?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    No, God forbid!

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    I would those words proceeded from your heart.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Inconstant Edmund, dost thou favour him, 104
    That wast the cause of his imprisonment?

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    The more cause have I now to make amends.

YOUNG MORTIMER[Aside to Q. ISAB.]

    I tell thee, ’tis not meet that one so false
    Should come about the person of a prince.— 108
    My lord, he hath betray’d the king his brother,
    And therefore trust him not.

PRINCE EDWARD

    But he repents, and sorrows for it now.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Come, son, and go with this gentle lord and me. 112

PRINCE EDWARD

    With you I will, but not with Mortimer.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Why, youngling, ’sdain’st thou so of Mortimer?
    Then I will carry thee by force away.

PRINCE EDWARD

    Help, uncle Kent! Mortimer will wrong me. 116

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Brother Edmund, strive not; we are his friends;
    Isabel is nearer than the Earl of Kent.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Sister, Edward is my charge, redeem him.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Edward is my son, and I will keep him. 120

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Mortimer shall know that he hath wrong’d me!—
    Hence will I haste to Killingworth Castle,
    And rescue aged Edward from his foes,
    To be reveng’d on Mortimer and thee.

MATREVIS

    My lord, be not pensive, we are your friends;
    Men are ordain’d to live in misery,
    Therefore come,—dalliance dangereth our lives.

KING EDWARD

    Friends, whither must unhappy Edward go? 4
    Will hateful Mortimer appoint no rest?
    Must I be vexed like the nightly bird,
    Whose sight is loathsome to all winged fowls?
    When will the fury of his mind assuage? 8
    When will his heart be satisfied with blood?
    If mine will serve, unbowel straight this breast,
    And give my heart to Isabel and him;
    It is the chiefest mark they level at. 12

GURNEY

    Not so my liege, the queen hath given this charge
    To keep your grace in safety;
    Your passions make your dolours to increase.

KING EDWARD

    This usage makes my misery to increase. 16
    But can my air of life continue long
    When all my senses are annoy’d with stench?
    Within a dungeon England’s king is kept,
    Where I am starv’d for want of sustenance. 20
    My daily diet is heart-breaking sobs,
    That almost rents the closet of my heart.
    Thus lives old Edward not reliev’d by any,
    And so must die, though pitied by many. 24
    O, water, gentle friends, to cool my thirst,
    And clear my body from foul excrements!

MATREVIS

    Here’s channel water, as our charge is given.
    Sit down, for we’ll be barbers to your grace. 28

KING EDWARD

    Traitors, away! What, will you murder me,
    Or choke your sovereign with puddle water?

GURNEY

    No; but wash your face, and shave away your beard,
    Lest you be known and so be rescued. 32

MATREVIS

    Why strive you thus? Your labour is in vain!

KING EDWARD

    The wren may strive against the lion’s strength,
    But all in vain: so vainly do I strive
    To seek for mercy at a tyrant’s hand. They wash him with puddle water, and shave his beard away. 36
    Immortal powers! that knows the painful cares
    That wait upon my poor distressed soul,
    O level all your looks upon these daring men,
    That wrongs their liege and sovereign, England’s king! 40
    O Gaveston, ’tis for thee that I am wrong’d,
    For me, both thou and both the Spencers died!
    And for your sakes a thousand wrongs I’ll take.
    The Spencers’ ghosts, wherever they remain, 44
    Wish well to mine; then tush, for them I’ll die.

MATREVIS

    ’Twixt theirs and yours shall be no enmity.
    Come, come away; now put the torches out,
    We’ll enter in by darkness to Killingworth. 48

[Enter KENT]

GURNEY

    How now, who comes there?

MATREVIS

    Guard the king sure: it is the Earl of Kent.

KING EDWARD

    O gentle brother, help to rescue me!

MATREVIS

    Keep them asunder; thrust in the king. 52

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Soldiers, let me but talk to him one word.

GURNEY

    Lay hands upon the earl for his assault.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Lay down your weapons, traitors! Yield the king!

MATREVIS

    Edmund, yield thou thyself, or thou shalt die. 56

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Base villains, wherefore do you gripe me thus?

GURNEY

    Bind him and so convey him to the court.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Where is the court but here? Here is the king;
    And I will visit him; why stay you me? 60

MATREVIS

    The court is where Lord Mortimer remains;
    Thither shall your honour go; and so farewell.

[Exeunt MATREVIS and GURNEY, with KING EDWARD.]

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    O miserable is that commonweal,
    Where lords keep courts, and kings are locked in prison! 64

SOLDIER

    Wherefore stay we? On, sirs, to the court!

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Ay, lead me whither you will, even to my death,
    Seeing that my brother cannot be releas’d.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    The king must die, or Mortimer goes down;
    The commons now begin to pity him.
    Yet he that is the cause of Edward’s death,
    Is sure to pay for it when his son’s of age; 4
    And therefore will I do it cunningly.
    This letter, written by a friend of ours,
    Contains his death, yet bids them save his life. [Reads.]
    “Edwardum occidere nolite timere, bonum est 8
    Fear not to kill the king, ’tis good he die.”
    But read it thus, and that’s another sense:
    “Edwardum occidere nolite, timere bonum est
    Kill not the king, ’tis good to fear the worst.” 12
    Unpointed as it is, thus shall it go,
    That, being dead, if it chance to be found,
    Matrevis and the rest may bear the blame,
    And we be quit that caus’d it to be done. 16
    Within this room is lock’d the messenger
    That shall convey it, and perform the rest;
    And by a secret token that he bears,
    Shall he be murdered when the deed is done.— 20
    Lightborn, come forth!

[Enter LIGHTBORN]

    Art thou as resolute as thou wast?

LIGHTBORN

    What else, my lord? And far more resolute.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    And hast thou cast how to accomplish it? 24

LIGHTBORN

    Ay, ay, and none shall know which way he died.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    But at his looks, Lightborn, thou wilt relent.

LIGHTBORN

    Relent! ha, ha! I use much to relent.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Well, do it bravely, and be secret. 28

LIGHTBORN

    You shall not need to give instructions;
    ’Tis not the first time I have kill’d a man.
    I learn’d in Naples how to poison flowers;
    To strangle with a lawn thrust through the throat; 32
    To pierce the windpipe with a needle’s point;
    Or whilst one is asleep, to take a quill
    And blow a little powder in his ears;
    Or open his mouth and pour quicksilver down. 36
    And yet I have a braver way than these.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    What’s that?

LIGHTBORN

    Nay, you shall pardon me; none shall know my tricks.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    I care not how it is, so it be not spied. [Gives letter.] 40
    Deliver this to Gurney and Matrevis.
    At every ten mile end thou hast a horse.
    Take this; [Gives money] away! and never see me more.

LIGHTBORN

    No! 44

YOUNG MORTIMER

    No;
    Unless thou bring me news of Edward’s death.

LIGHTBORN

    That will I quickly do. Farewell, my lord.

[Exit.] YOUNG MORTIMER

    The prince I rule, the queen do I command, 48
    And with a lowly conge to the ground,
    The proudest lords salute me as I pass;
    I seal, I cancel, I do what I will.
    Fear’d am I more than lov’d;—let me be fear’d, 52
    And when I frown, make all the court look pale.
    I view the prince with Aristarchus’ eyes,
    Whose looks were as a breeching to a boy.
    They thrust upon me the protectorship, 56
    And sue to me for that that I desire.
    While at the council-table, grave enough,
    And not unlike a bashful puritan,
    First I complain of imbecility, 60
    Saying it is onus quam gravissimum, 2
    Till being interrupted by my friends,
    Suscepi that provinciam as they term it;
    And to conclude, I am Protector now. 64
    Now is all sure: the queen and Mortimer
    Shall rule the realm, the king; and none rule us.
    Mine enemies will I plague, my friends advance;
    And what I list command who dare control? 68
    Major sum quam cui possit fortuna nocere.
    And that this be the coronation-day,
    It pleaseth me, and Isabel the queen. [Trumpets within.]
    The trumpets sound, I must go take my place. 72

[Enter the Young KING, QUEEN ISABELLA, the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, Champion and Nobles]

ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

    Long live King Edward, by the grace of God
    King of England and Lord of Ireland!

CHAMPION

    If any Christian, Heathen, Turk, or Jew,
    Dares but affirm that Edward’s not true king, 76
    And will avouch his saying with the sword,
    I am the champion that will combat him.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    None comes, sound trumpets. [Trumpets sound.]

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Champion, here’s to thee. [Gives a purse.] 80

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Lord Mortimer, now take him to your charge.

[Enter Soldiers, with KENT prisoner]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    What traitor have we there with blades and bills?

SOLDIER

    Edmund, the Earl of Kent.

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    What hath he done? 84

SOLDIER

    A would have taken the king away perforce,
    As we were bringing him to Killingworth.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Did you attempt this rescue, Edmund? Speak.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Mortimer, I did; he is our king, 88
    And thou compell’st this prince to wear the crown.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Strike off his head! he shall have martial law.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Strike off my head! Base traitor, I defy thee!

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    My lord, he is my uncle, and shall live. 92

YOUNG MORTIMER

    My lord, he is your enemy, and shall die.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Stay, villains!

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Sweet mother, if I cannot pardon him,
    Entreat my Lord Protector for his life. 96

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Son, be content; I dare not speak a word.

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Nor I, and yet methinks I should command;
    But, seeing I cannot, I’ll entreat for him—
    My lord, if you will let my uncle live, 100
    I will requite it when I come to age.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    ’Tis for your highness’ good, and for the realm’s.—
    How often shall I bid you bear him hence?

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Art thou king? Must I die at thy command? 104

YOUNG MORTIMER

    At our command—Once more away with him.

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

    Let me but stay and speak; I will not go.
    Either my brother or his son is king,
    And none of both them thirst for Edmund’s blood: 108
    And therefore, soldiers, whither will you hale me?

[Soldiers hale KENT away, to be beheaded. ]

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    What safety may I look for at his hands,
    If that my uncle shall be murdered thus?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Fear not, sweet boy, I’ll guard thee from thy foes; 112
    Had Edmund lived, he would have sought thy death.
    Come, son, we’ll ride a-hunting in the park.

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    And shall my uncle Edmund ride with us?

QUEEN ISABELLA

    He is a traitor; think not on him; come. 

MATREVIS

    Gurney, I wonder the king dies not,
    Being in a vault up to the knees in water,
    To which the channels of the castle run,
    From whence a damp continually ariseth, 4
    That were enough to poison any man,
    Much more a king brought up so tenderly.

GURNEY

    And so do I, Matrevis: yesternight
    I opened but the door to throw him meat, 8
    And I was almost stifled with the savour.

MATREVIS

    He hath a body able to endure
    More than we can inflict: and therefore now
    Let us assail his mind another while. 12

GURNEY

    Send for him out thence, and I will anger him.

MATREVIS

    But stay, who’s this?

[Enter LIGHTBORN]

LIGHTBORN

    My Lord Protector greets you. [Gives letter.]

GURNEY

    What’s here? I know not how to construe it. 16

MATREVIS

    Gurney, it was left unpointed for the nonce;
    “Edwardum occidere nolite timere,”
    That’s his meaning.

LIGHTBORN

    Know ye this token? I must have the king. [Gives token.] 20

MATREVIS

    Ay, stay awhile, thou shalt have answer straight.
    This villain’s sent to make away the king. [Aside.]

GURNEY

    I thought as much. [Aside.]

MATREVIS

    And when the murder’s done, 24
    See how he must be handled for his labour.
    Pereat iste! Let him have the king. [Aside.]
    What else? Here is the key, this is the lake,
    Do as you are commanded by my lord. 28

LIGHTBORN

    I Know what I must do. Get you away.
    Yet be not far off, I shall need your help;
    See that in the next room I have a fire,
    And get me a spit, and let it be red-hot. 32

MATREVIS

    Very well.

GURNEY

    Need you anything besides?

LIGHTBORN

    What else? A table and a feather-bed.

GURNEY

    That’s all? 36

LIGHTBORN

    Ay, ay; so, when I call you, bring it in.

MATREVIS

    Fear not thou that.

GURNEY

    Here’s a light, to go into the dungeon. [Gives a light, and then exit with MATREVIS.]

LIGHTBORN

    So now 40
    Must I about this gear; ne’er was there any
    So finely handled as this king shall be.
    For, here’s a place indeed, with all my heart!

KING EDWARD

    Who’s there? What light is that? wherefore com’st thou? 44

LIGHTBORN

    To comfort you, and bring you joyful news.

KING EDWARD

    Small comfort finds poor Edward in thy looks.
    Villain, I know thou com’st to murder me.

LIGHTBORN

    To murder you, my most gracious lord! 48
    Far is it from my heart to do you harm.
    The queen sent me to see how you were used,
    For she relents at this your misery:
    And what eyes can refrain from shedding tears, 52
    To see a king in this most piteous state?

KING EDWARD

    Weep’st thou already? List awhile to me
    And then thy heart, were it as Gurney’s is,
    Or as Matrevis’, hewn from the Caucasus, 56
    Yet will it melt, ere I have done my tale.
    This dungeon where they keep me is the sink
    Wherein the filth of all the castle falls.

LIGHTBORN

    O villains! 60

KING EDWARD

    And there in mire and puddle have I stood
    This ten days’ space; and, lest that I should sleep,
    One plays continually upon a drum.
    They give me bread and water, being a king; 64
    So that, for want of sleep and sustenance,
    My mind’s distempered, and my body’s numb’d,
    And whether I have limbs or no I know not.
    O, would my blood dropp’d out from every vein, 68
    As doth this water from my tattered robes.
    Tell Isabel, the queen, I look’d not thus,
    When for her sake I ran at tilt in France,
    And there unhors’d the Duke of Cleremont. 72

LIGHTBORN

    O speak no more, my lord! this breaks my heart.
    Lie on this bed, and rest yourself awhile.

KING EDWARD

    These looks of thine can harbour nought but death:
    I see my tragedy written in thy brows. 76
    Yet stay a while; forbear thy bloody hand,
    And let me see the stroke before it comes,
    That even then when I shall lose my life,
    My mind may be more steadfast on my God. 80

LIGHTBORN

    What means your highness to mistrust me thus?

KING EDWARD

    What mean’st thou to dissemble with me thus?

LIGHTBORN

    These hands were never stain’d with innocent blood,
    Nor shall they now be tainted with a king’s. 84

KING EDWARD

    Forgive my thought for having such a thought.
    One jewel have I left; receive thou this. [Giving jewel.]
    Still fear I, and I know not what’s the cause,
    But every joint shakes as I give it thee. 88
    O, if thou harbour’st murder in thy heart,
    Let this gift change thy mind, and save thy soul!
    Know that I am a king: O, at that name
    I feel a hell of grief! Where is my crown? 92
    Gone, gone! and do I still remain alive?

LIGHTBORN

    You’re overwatch’d, my lord; lie down and rest.

KING EDWARD

    But that grief keeps me waking, I should sleep;
    For not these ten days have these eye-lids clos’d. 96
    Now as I speak they fall, and yet with fear
    Open again. O wherefore sitt’st thou here?

LIGHTBORN

    If you mistrust me, I’ll begone, my lord.

KING EDWARD

    No, no, for if thou mean’st to murder me, 100
    Thou wilt return again, and therefore stay. [Sleeps.]

LIGHTBORN

    He sleeps.

KING EDWARD[waking].

    O let me not die yet! O stay a while!

LIGHTBORN

    How now, my lord? 104

KING EDWARD

    Something still buzzeth in mine ears,
    And tells me if I sleep I never wake;
    This fear is that which makes me tremble thus.
    And therefore tell me, wherefore art thou come? 108

LIGHTBORN

    To rid thee of thy life.—Matrevis, come!

[Enter MATREVIS and GURNEY]

KING EDWARD

    I am too weak and feeble to resist:—
    Assist me, sweet God, and receive my soul!

LIGHTBORN

    Run for the table. 112

KING EDWARD

    O spare me, or despatch me in a trice. [MATREVIS brings in a table.]

LIGHTBORN

    So, lay the table down, and stamp on it,
    But not too hard, lest that you bruise his body.

[KING EDWARD is murdered.] MATREVIS

    I fear me that this cry will raise the town, 116
    And therefore, let us take horse and away.

LIGHTBORN

    Tell me, sirs, was it not bravely done?

GURNEY

    Excellent well: take this for thy reward. [GURNEY stabs LIGHTBORN (who dies.}]
    Come, let us cast the body in the moat, 120
    And bear the king’s to Mortimer our lord:
    Away! 

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Is’t done, Matrevis, and the murderer dead?

MATREVIS

    Ay, my good lord; I would it were undone!

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Matrevis, if thou now growest penitent
    I’ll be thy ghostly father; therefore choose, 4
    Whether thou wilt be secret in this,
    Or else die by the hand of Mortimer.

MATREVIS

    Gurney, my lord, is fled, and will, I fear
    Betray us both, therefore let me fly. 8

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Fly to the savages!

MATREVIS

    I humbly thank your honour. [Exit.]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    As for myself, I stand as Jove’s huge tree,
    And others are but shrubs compar’d to me. 12
    All tremble at my name, and I fear none;
    Let’s see who dare impeach me for his death!

[Enter QUEEN ISABELLA]

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Ah, Mortimer, the king my son hath news
    His father’s dead, and we have murdered him! 16

YOUNG MORTIMER

    What if he have? The king is yet a child.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Ay, but he tears his hair, and wrings his hands,
    And vows to be reveng’d upon us both.
    Into the council-chamber he is gone, 20
    To crave the aid and succour of his peers.
    Ay me! see here he comes, and they with him.
    Now, Mortimer, begins our tragedy.

[Enter KING EDWARD THE THIRD, LORDS, and Attendants.]

1ST LORD

    Fear not, my lord, know that you are a king. 24

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Villain!—

YOUNG MORTIMER

    How now, my lord!

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Think not that I am frighted with thy words!
    My father’s murdered through thy treachery; 28
    And thou shalt die, and on his mournful hearse
    Thy hateful and accursed head shall lie,
    To witness to the world, that by thy means
    His kingly body was too soon interr’d. 32

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Weep not, sweet son!

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Forbid me not to weep; he was my father;
    And, had you lov’d him half so well as I,
    You could not bear his death thus patiently. 36
    But you, I fear, conspir’d with Mortimer.

1ST LORD

    Why speak you not unto my lord the king?

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Because I think scorn to be accus’d.
    Who is the man dares say I murdered him? 40

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Traitor! in me my loving father speaks,
    And plainly saith, ’twas thou that murd’redst him.

YOUNG MORTIMER

    But has your grace no other proof than this?

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Yes, if this be the hand of Mortimer. [Shewing letter.] 44

YOUNG MORTIMER

    False Gurney hath betray’d me and himself. [Aside.]

QUEEN ISABELLA

    I fear’d as much; murder cannot be hid. [Aside.]

YOUNG MORTIMER

    It is my hand; what gather you by this?

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    That thither thou didst send a murderer. 48

YOUNG MORTIMER

    What murderer? Bring forth the man I sent.

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Ah, Mortimer, thou knowest that he is slain;
    And so shalt thou be too.—Why stays he here
    Bring him unto a hurdle, drag him forth; 52
    Hang him, I say, and set his quarters up;
    But bring his head back presently to me.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    For my sake, sweet son, pity Mortimer!

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Madam, entreat not, I will rather die, 56
    Than sue for life unto a paltry boy.

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Hence with the traitor! with the murderer!

YOUNG MORTIMER

    Base Fortune, now I see, that in thy wheel
    There is a point, to which when men aspire, 60
    They tumble headlong down: that point I touch’d,
    And, seeing there was no place to mount up higher,
    Why should I grieve at my declining fall?—
    Farewell, fair queen; weep not for Mortimer, 64
    That scorns the world, and, as a traveller,
    Goes to discover countries yet unknown.

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    What! suffer you the traitor to delay?

[Young MORTIMER is taken away by First Lord and Attendants.] QUEEN ISABELLA

    As thou receivedest thy life from me, 68
    Spill not the blood of gentle Mortimer!

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    This argues that you spilt my father’s blood,
    Else would you not entreat for Mortimer.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    I spill his blood? No. 72

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Ay, madam, you; for so the rumour runs.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    That rumour is untrue; for loving thee,
    Is this report rais’d on poor Isabel.

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    I do not think her so unnatural. 76

2ND LORD

    My lord, I fear me it will prove too true.

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Mother, you are suspected for his death
    And therefore we commit you to the Tower
    Till farther trial may be made thereof; 80
    If you be guilty, though I be your son,
    Think not to find me slack or pitiful.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Nay, to my death, for too long have I liv’d
    Whenas my son thinks to abridge my days. 84

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Away with her, her words enforce these tears,
    And I shall pity her if she speak again.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Shall I not mourn for my beloved lord,
    And with the rest accompany him to his grave? 88

2ND LORD

    Thus, madam, ’tis the king’s will you shall hence.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    He hath forgotten me; stay, I am his mother.

2ND LORD

    That boots not; therefore, gentle madam, go.

QUEEN ISABELLA

    Then come, sweet death, and rid me of this grief. [Exit.] 92

[Re-enter 1st Lord, with the head of Young MORTIMER]

1ST LORD

    My lord, here is the head of Mortimer.

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

    Go fetch my father’s hearse, where it shall lie;
    And bring my funeral robes. [Exeunt Attendants.]
    Accursed head, 96
    Could I have rul’d thee then, as I do now,
    Thou had’st not hatch’d this monstrous treachery!—
    Here comes the hearse; help me to mourn, my lords.

[Re-enter Attendants with the hearse and funeral robes]

    Sweet father, here unto thy murdered ghost 100
    I offer up this wicked traitor’s head;
    And let these tears, distilling from mine eyes,
    Be witness of my grief and innocency.
